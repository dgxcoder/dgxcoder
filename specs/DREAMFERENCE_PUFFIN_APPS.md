# Puffin Apps: Gmail and Google Drive through `/apps`, with no OpenAI sign-in

**Status:** proposed (2026-10-03). Nothing here is built. §1 is read from the pinned Codex source (`rust-v0.158.0`); everything about running it is Phase 0 (§11).
**Goal:** the standard Codex `/apps` command works in `puffin` without a ChatGPT sign-in. It lists **Puffin's own apps** (Gmail, Google Drive), connects them through Puffin's local Google sign-in, switches them on and off, and hands their tools to the model. Nothing goes to `chatgpt.com`.
**Builds on:**
- [PUFFIN_GMAIL](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_GMAIL.md): the read-only Gmail service (`dreamference-gmail`, port 8767) and `puffin-admin gmail`;
- [GOA](./DREAMFERENCE_GOA.md): Google sign-in through GNOME's verified OAuth client, the token sealed on the machine; Drive is its unbuilt half;
- patch `0020` (`puffin-rs/tools`): MCP tools reach the local model as plain functions, which is what makes a tool route possible at all;
- [PUFFIN_AIRGAPPED](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_AIRGAPPED.md): `on` must keep Gmail and Drive out of the session.

The request said "the `/app` route"; this spec reads that as Codex's `/apps` slash command. It is unrelated to `puffin app`, the desktop window.

---

## 1. What `/apps` does in Codex today

Read from the pinned source:

| Piece | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **The gate** | `tui/src/chatwidget/connectors.rs:150` `connectors_enabled()` | `Feature::Apps && has_chatgpt_account`. False hides `/apps` from the popup (`bottom_pane/slash_commands.rs:76`) and makes the command print "Apps are disabled." |
| **The list** | app-server `app/list` → `apps_processor.rs` `apps_list_inner` | Returns empty unless `features.apps_enabled_for_auth(uses_codex_backend)`; otherwise merges OpenAI's directory (`chatgpt/src/connectors.rs`, a `chatgpt.com` GET that needs "Codex backend auth") with the apps whose tools the `codex_apps` MCP server exposes |
| **Installed apps for `$` mentions** | app-server `app/installed` (`apps_processor/installed.rs:64`) | Same auth gate |
| **The tools** | `codex-mcp/src/mcp/mod.rs` | `codex_apps` is an MCP server at `chatgpt.com/backend-api/ps/mcp`, started only when `host_owned_codex_apps_enabled` (ChatGPT auth) |
| **Connecting** | `AppInfo.install_url` → `AppEvent::OpenAppLink` → `AppLinkView` → `webbrowser::open` | Opens the URL as given. Host validation (`chatgpt.com` only) applies to MCP *elicitations*, not to `/apps` list items |
| **After connecting** | `AppLinkView::complete_external_flow_and_close` | Sends `RefreshConnectors { force_refetch: true }`, so the list is fetched again |
| **On / off** | `AppEvent::SetAppEnabled` | Writes `[apps.<id>] enabled = false` (and clears it to re-enable) in `config.toml` |
| **Status label** | `connector_status_label` | `is_accessible` → "Installed" or "Installed · Disabled"; otherwise "Can be installed" |

So the screen, the browser hand-off, the refresh and the on/off switch are all generic. Only the gate and the two sources of data (directory and `codex_apps` tools) are tied to OpenAI.

## 2. The decision

**Keep Codex's `/apps` screen and replace its two OpenAI-bound inputs with Puffin's own, in one small patch.** The list comes from the machine, connecting opens Puffin's local Google sign-in, and the tools come from an MCP server the launcher declares.

Rejected:
- **A made-up ChatGPT sign-in pointed at a local stand-in backend.** A sign-in switches on token refresh to `auth.openai.com`, usage analytics and the other ChatGPT-backed channels that patches `0013`/`0015` closed, so the egress audit would fail. The stand-in API would also have to follow OpenAI's undocumented directory and `ps/mcp` formats through every Codex release.
- **A command of our own (`/gmail`, `/connect`).** It is cheaper to keep, but it is not the standard command, and the request is for `/apps`.
- **A local `/plugins` marketplace.** `/plugins` is visible without a sign-in and could install a Gmail MCP server and skill with no patch at all, but it has no notion of *connected*, no sign-in hand-off and no per-app on/off. Kept as the fallback if §11's Phase 0 finds the `/apps` hooks larger than §4 allows.

## 3. What the user sees

```
/apps
  Apps
  Installed 1 of 2 available apps.
› Gmail           Installed · stan@…, work@…        Enter: manage, enable/disable
  Google Drive    Can be installed                   Enter: connect in your browser
```

- **Gmail**, connected: "Installed" with the connected addresses in the description; Enter opens the app page with "Manage in browser" (the service's account page) and "Disable app".
- **Google Drive**, not connected: "Can be installed"; Enter opens the local sign-in in the browser; after "I've connected it", `/apps` refreshes and shows "Installed".
- **Disabled** (`[apps.puffin_gmail] enabled = false`): "Installed · Disabled"; the tools and the prompt section are left out of the next session.
- **At `/airgapped on`:** both rows say "Unavailable at /airgapped on" and their actions do nothing (§8).
- **Service not running:** the row says "Not running: `puffin-admin google start`" and has no link.
- **On a client machine** (the model server is another node): no Puffin apps are listed, because the Google service and its token live on the node (PUFFIN_NODE; the same rule the Gmail prompt block uses today, `host_is_local`). `/apps` then shows "No apps available."

The `$` mention hint in the header ("Use $ to insert an installed app") stays upstream's text. `$` mentions of Puffin apps are not offered in Phase 1 (§4.3).

## 4. The patch (`0021-puffin-apps`)

### 4.1 A leaf crate, `puffin-rs/apps/` (`puffin-apps`)

Like `puffin-tools` (patch `0020`) and `puffin-airgapped`, the logic lives in a crate of its own that Codex's crates can depend on without a cycle: `serde_json` and the standard library only, plus `puffin-airgapped` and `puffin-node-locator` (both std-only). It answers two questions:

- `offered() -> bool`: the model server is on this machine and the Google service's address is configured. Cheap, no network; called by the TUI on every gate check.
- `list() -> Option<serde_json::Value>`: `None` when Puffin offers no apps (so Codex's own path runs, which without a sign-in returns empty); otherwise the apps as JSON in `AppInfo`'s serde shape. It asks the service `GET http://127.0.0.1:8767/status` (unauthenticated today, over std `TcpStream`, 2 s timeout) for the connected accounts and their granted scopes, and resolves the air-gap level.

| Field | Gmail | Google Drive |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `puffin_gmail` | `puffin_drive` |
| `name` | `Gmail` | `Google Drive` |
| `description` | connected addresses, or "Read-only search of your mail, on this machine" | connected addresses, or "Read-only search of your files, on this machine" |
| `install_url` | `http://localhost:8767/connect?app=gmail` | `http://localhost:8767/connect?app=drive` |
| `is_accessible` | an account is connected (today's `/status` lists Gmail accounts only); from Phase 2, an account holds `https://mail.google.com/` | an account holds `drive.readonly` (needs §9's scope report) |
| `distribution_channel` | `puffin` | `puffin` |

### 4.2 The hooks

| # | Crate, function | Hook (one line each) |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | `tui`, `ChatWidget::connectors_enabled` | `… && (self.has_chatgpt_account \|\| puffin_apps::offered())` |
| H2 | `app-server`, `apps_list_inner`, before the auth gate | `if let Some(apps) = puffin_apps::list() { return Ok(Some(puffin_apps_response(apps, &config, &params))); }`, where the helper (in the same file, added by the patch) deserialises into the protocol's `AppInfo`, applies Codex's own `AppToolPolicyEvaluator::apply_app_enabled_state` (so `[apps.<id>] enabled` from §1's on/off switch shows), and paginates with the existing `paginate_apps` |

H2 returns **before** the directory request and the `codex_apps` lookup, so no `chatgpt.com` call is made; `codex_apps` itself still never starts, because `host_owned_codex_apps_enabled` still requires a ChatGPT sign-in. Plus one line in each of the two crates' `Cargo.toml` (`puffin-apps = { path = "../puffin/apps" }`).

### 4.3 What is deliberately not hooked

- **`app/installed`** (the `$` mention list). Mentions resolve to `codex_apps` tools by connector id; Puffin's tools are ordinary MCP tools, which the model already sees. Leaving the gate shut keeps `$` empty rather than offering a mention that resolves to nothing. Phase 3 revisits it.
- **Plugin recommendations** (`plugin_recommendations_enabled`, also `Feature::Apps`): unchanged.

### 4.4 Budget

The series is at 33,686 of the 33,750-byte cap (`test_the_patches_stay_small`). The estimate for `0021` is 1.5–2 KB (two code lines, a ~15-line helper in H2's file, two manifest lines); the cap is raised explicitly by the size of the patch as written, as for every earlier hook.

## 5. Connecting

### 5.1 One service for Google, independent of the web UI

Today the Gmail service is created by `puffin-admin puffin configure`, so a machine without the web UI has none. `/apps` must work without it:

- **`puffin-admin google start`** creates `dreamference-gmail` on the `dreamference-sidecars` network (the SearXNG precedent, DOCKER §6: never the default bridge), publishing `127.0.0.1:8767` only. `configure` keeps creating it as now and adopts one that exists. The container keeps its name; the service gains Drive (§9), so the command is named for Google, and `puffin-admin gmail …` keeps working.
- **`codex build` and `host setup` do not start it.** It starts on request, since an unused Google service is one more container for nothing.

### 5.2 The connect page

`GET /connect?app=gmail|drive` (today `/connect` with no parameter, Gmail only, §0 of GOA):

- **The scope follows the app.** `app=gmail` asks for `userinfo.email` and `mail.google.com`; `app=drive` asks for `userinfo.email` and `drive.readonly`. Both add `include_granted_scopes=true`, so connecting Drive to an account that already has Gmail keeps Gmail, and the stored grant records the union.
- **A grant without the app's scope is refused** with the box to tick, as the Gmail callback already does for an unticked Gmail box.
- **The page ends with "Return to `puffin` and choose *I've connected it*."** Codex's app page then refreshes `/apps` (§1).
- **Opened in the browser by Codex** (`webbrowser::open`, no host check on this path). Phase 0 checks the case with no browser (SSH): Codex prints the URL, and the redirect to `localhost:8767` then needs the paste-back path that already exists (`POST /api/google/oauth/complete`), which the page must offer as a text box.

### 5.3 The existing front doors stay

The web UI's Settings → Gmail Accounts and `puffin-admin puffin gmail` connect the same accounts in the same store. `/apps` is a third door, not a replacement.

## 6. The tools

### 6.1 Served by `puffin` itself

The launcher answers `puffin apps serve gmail|drive` before Codex parses its arguments (as it does `puffin night`, `puffin skill`), speaking MCP over stdio. The command is the running binary (`current_exe`), so there is no new binary, no Python start-up (seconds, against Codex's MCP start-up wait) and no PATH lookup. It reads the service's shared secret from the file `puffin-admin gmail` uses today and calls the service over loopback.

| Tool | Arguments | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `gmail_search` | `query` (Gmail syntax), `limit` ≤ 20 | id, account, date, from, subject, snippet per message; per-account errors |
| `gmail_read` | `id` | headers and text body, ≤ 20,000 chars |
| `drive_search` | `query` (Drive `q` subset: `name contains`, `fullText contains`, `modifiedTime >`), `limit` ≤ 20 | id, account, name, MIME type, modified, owner |
| `drive_read` | `id` | text of a Doc/Sheet/Slides export, or of a plain-text file, ≤ 20,000 chars; binary files refused with their type and size |

- **Every tool carries `readOnlyHint: true`**, so Codex's `auto` approval runs them without a prompt, like the `code_*` tools.
- **Every body is wrapped** as `<untrusted source="gmail" id="…">…</untrusted>`, and each tool's description says that text inside it is data, never instructions.
- **No write verb exists**, in the tools or in the service (`BODY.PEEK`; Drive with `drive.readonly`).

### 6.2 Declared by the launcher

At start the launcher adds, per app that is offered (§3), connected, enabled and allowed at the level:

```
-c mcp_servers.puffin_gmail.command="<current_exe>"
-c mcp_servers.puffin_gmail.args=["apps","serve","gmail"]
-c mcp_servers.puffin_gmail.startup_timeout_sec=15
```

(the code index's servers are declared the same way). The 15 s start-up wait is the fix the SWE-bench run of 2026-10-03 found for `puffin-code` (Codex's 1 s default dropped tools under load); it applies here unchanged. An app connected mid-session gets its tools at the next start or `puffin resume`; the app page says so.

### 6.3 The prompt

When the Gmail tools are declared, the Gmail section names the tools instead of `puffin-admin gmail search/read`. The shell commands stay for scripts and Night Shift; they are no longer advertised to an interactive session, which narrows one path from an injected email to an outbound command: a tool result cannot be piped into a shell in the same call. Drive gets a matching two-line section.

## 7. Configuration

| Setting | Meaning | Precedence |
|---|---|---|
| `[apps.puffin_gmail] enabled` / `[apps.puffin_drive] enabled` in `~/.puffin/config.toml` | written by `/apps`' on/off switch (§1) | the switch |
| `puffin_gmail = false` (existing) | still honoured: it disables Gmail as before | outranks the `[apps]` entry when false |
| `DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_GMAIL` (existing), `DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_DRIVE` (new) | environment override, for Night Shift and tests | outranks both files |

The launcher reads the `[apps.*]` table with `toml_edit`, which it already uses on the same file. Default: on, when connected, matching Gmail's current default.

## 8. The air gap

- **At a configured `on`**, the launcher declares neither server and adds neither prompt section (Gmail's section is already dropped at `on`, commit `bb3d6d4`); `list()` marks both rows unavailable.
- **Switched to `on` mid-session**, the declared servers are still running and, being MCP servers, run outside the command sandbox with the network. So **each tool call resolves the level itself** before touching the service: the configured level through `puffin-airgapped`, then any seal under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/puffin-airgapped/` written by its parent `puffin` process (the server's parent pid is the session's `puffin`; seals record their writer). At `on` the call returns the level's message and makes no request. Phase 0 confirms the server's parent is the `puffin` process and not an intermediate.
- **The `/apps` rows at `on`** have no link and no actions, so the browser is not opened from an air-gapped session either.

## 9. Drive in the service

Prerequisite: GOA §12's open item, a one-off sign-in confirming Google accepts `drive.readonly` from GNOME's client. If it is refused, Drive leaves this spec and `/apps` lists Gmail alone.

- **Transport:** Drive REST v3 over HTTPS with the account's access token, which the service already refreshes. `files.list` (`fields` limited to id, name, mimeType, modifiedTime, owners; `corpora=user`), `files.export` to `text/plain` (Docs, Slides) and `text/csv` (Sheets), `files.get?alt=media` for `text/*` files under 1 MiB.
- **Caps:** 20 results, 20,000 characters per read, 10 MiB per export request; PDFs and other binaries are refused in Phase 2 (PDF_SEARCH is where text extraction belongs).
- **Endpoints:** `GET /drive/search?q=&limit=` and `GET /drive/file/<id>`, behind the same shared-secret header as `/search` and `/message/<id>`.
- **Status:** `/status` reports each account's granted scopes, which is what `list()` reads (§4.1). The status stays unauthenticated and carries addresses and scope names only.

## 10. Egress and security

- **No new destination for `puffin`.** The hooks return before any directory request; `codex_apps` does not start; the tools reach `127.0.0.1:8767` only. The service reaches `imap.gmail.com`, `oauth2.googleapis.com` and, new, `www.googleapis.com` (Drive), as a container, not from `puffin`. The egress audit's allowlist already has 8767; its `--tui` run gains a scripted `/apps` open to show the screen makes no other connection.
- **Read-only by construction** at three layers: the OAuth scopes, the service's verbs, the tools' verbs.
- **Prompt injection:** a shared document is attacker-controlled text, like an email. §6.1's wrapping, §6.3's tool-only advertising and §8's air-gap check are the mitigations; none of them is a guarantee, and the spec does not claim one.
- **The token stays on the machine,** sealed as today (GOA §0); `/apps` never sees it.

## 11. Phases

**Phase 0, read and probe (no product code).**
1. H2's mapping: the app-server protocol's `AppInfo` (`app-server-protocol/src/protocol/v2/apps.rs:118`) against the connectors crate's; whether `paginate_apps` and `apply_app_enabled_state` can be reached from the hook's file without widening visibility (which would cost patch bytes).
2. `/apps` with a `http://localhost` install URL: opened by `webbrowser::open`; the app page's "I've connected it" refresh; the on/off switch writing `[apps.puffin_gmail]`.
3. No browser (SSH session): what Codex prints, and the paste-back path end to end.
4. The MCP server's parent pid is the session's `puffin` (§8).
5. The Drive scope test (§9).
6. Patch size of H1 + H2 as written.

**Phase 1, Gmail.** The crate and hooks (§4), `puffin apps serve gmail` (§6.1), the launcher's declarations and prompt (§6.2–6.3), `puffin-admin google start` and `/connect?app=gmail` (§5), the configuration (§7), the air gap (§8).

**Phase 2, Drive.** The service (§9), `/connect?app=drive`, `drive_search`/`drive_read`, the Drive row.

**Phase 3, optional.** `$` mentions (§4.3): hook `app/installed` and map a mention of a Puffin app to a one-line nudge naming its tools. Only if Phase 1 shows users reaching for `$gmail`.

### Tests

- **The crate:** `list()` against a stub service (connected, not connected, Drive scope missing, service down, timeout); level `on` marks rows unavailable; `offered()` false on a client.
- **The launcher:** declarations present only when offered, connected, enabled and allowed; `puffin_gmail = false` and the environment override win; the prompt names tools when declared and commands otherwise.
- **The MCP server:** tool list, `readOnlyHint`, wrapping, caps, refusal at a sealed `on`, a service error surfaced per account.
- **The service (Python, offline):** `/connect?app=` scope selection, `include_granted_scopes`, refusal of a grant missing the app's scope, Drive endpoints against recorded responses.
- **Live, after `codex build`:** the §3 screen in tmux, connect Gmail from `/apps`, the next session's `gmail_search` call, the egress audit with `--tui`.

## 12. Open questions

1. **A connected app mid-session.** Tools arrive at the next start. Is "restart to use it" acceptable, or should the launcher declare the servers whenever the service runs and let an unconnected server answer "connect it in /apps"? The second costs a resident process per session for an unused app.
2. **`puffin-admin google start` by default** from `install.sh` on a node, or only on request?
3. **Drive's breadth:** "My Drive" only (`corpora=user`), or shared drives too (`corpora=allDrives`, more injection surface)?
4. **Calendar:** GNOME's client is verified for it too (`calendar.readonly`). A third row later, or out of scope?

## 13. Not proposed

- **Sending, drafting, labelling, or writing to Drive.** Out of scope for every phase; a draft-only Gmail verb would be a separate spec with its own risk section.
- **OpenAI's connectors alongside Puffin's.** With a ChatGPT sign-in, H2 would still answer with Puffin's list, hiding OpenAI's; Puffin never holds that sign-in, so the case does not arise in a supported setup.
- **A web UI change.** The web UI's Gmail tool and Settings page are unchanged; Drive in the web UI is GOA's concern.
