# Puffin Node — splitting Puffin into a client and `puffin-node`

**Status:** proposed. Nothing in this spec is implemented yet. §2 and §13.8 list what was checked on this machine on 2026-10-01 and what is still assumed; with one GB10 here, nothing between two machines was run.
**Target:** the GB10 (DGX Spark) as the server, and Ubuntu, macOS and Windows machines on the same local network as clients.
**Builds on:**
- the launcher in `puffin-rs/` and its `vllm_host()` tiers ([PUFFIN_CODEX](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_CODEX.md));
- the web commands in `puffin-web-rs/` and the code index in `puffin-code-rs/` ([PUFFIN_CODE_INDEX](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_CODE_INDEX.md));
- the web UI and its desktop window ([ONYX](./DREAMFERENCE_ONYX.md));
- the model server and its host-safety layer ([INFERENCE](./DREAMFERENCE_INFERENCE.md));
- the trusted-LAN decision of 2026-09-30 ([README](./README.md), "Accepted by design");
- `/airgapped` and the egress audit ([PUFFIN_AIRGAPPED](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_AIRGAPPED.md), [PUFFIN_EGRESS](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_EGRESS.md)).

**Decisions made here, stated first because each could be read the other way:**

1. **`puffin-node` names a role, not a renamed command.** It is the server half of the product: the model server and its sidecars on a GB10, the service advertised on the network (`_puffin-node._tcp`), and the install profile. The node's command line stays `puffin-admin`, which gains a `node` group. Renaming the console script would break every install and the prompt's `puffin-admin gmail` line. If a `puffin-node` executable is wanted as well, it is an alias (§15, question 1).
2. **The client is Rust binaries only: no Python, no Docker.** `puffin`, `codex-code-mode-host`, `puffin-code`, `puffin-search`, `puffin-fetch` and `puffin-app`. Everything Python stays on the node.
3. **No new always-on daemon for the split.** The node's existing Avahi daemon advertises it, and clients talk to the services' own ports. A front-door reverse proxy was considered and rejected (§5.4). The one new process, a control agent for managing a node from another machine, exists only in the several-node phase and only where its owner switches it on (§12.4).
4. **No authentication and no TLS**, as the trusted-LAN decision says. Using a node (inference, search, the web UI) is open as soon as the node is advertised. Controlling one (loading or stopping its model from another machine) is a different class of act and has its own switch, off by default (§12.4).
5. **A GB10 gets both halves; every other machine gets the client only** (§9).
6. **Three parts, in order.** Part 1 is the split with one node (§3–§11). Part 2 is several nodes (§12). Part 3 is running jobs on another node (§13). Neither later part delays the first.
7. **Nodes have no roles.** Every node installs identically; there is no "primary" or "secondary" setting and no question at install time. The machine a person runs `puffin-admin node …` on is the one doing the managing (§12.4).

---

## 1. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**
- A person installs Puffin on a laptop, types `puffin`, and is talking to the model on the GB10 in the next room, with no address typed and no file edited.
- The same for `puffin-app` (the desktop window on the web UI) and for web search.
- The client runs on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows.
- On the GB10 itself nothing changes for the user: client and node are both installed and the client uses the local node.

**Non-goals**
- Access from outside the local network. Discovery is link-local by construction and nothing here crosses a router.
- Accounts, API keys, per-user quotas or TLS.
- A node on anything but a GB10. A Linux machine with another GPU gets the client only in this version.
- Night Shift, SWE-bench or the egress audit run from a remote client (§10).

## 2. What was checked, and what was not

Checked on this GB10 (`gx10-9428`, Wi-Fi address `192.168.0.105`) on 2026-10-01:

| Question | Result |
|---|---|
| Is an mDNS responder already running on the node? | Yes: `avahi-daemon` 0.8 is active and enabled; `/etc/avahi/services/` holds only `ssh.service`. |
| Does the service type work? | `avahi-publish -s puffin-spec-probe _puffin-node._tcp 8000 proto=1 version=1.2.0 node=… web=3000 search=8888`, run as an ordinary user, was browsed back with `avahi-browse -rtp`: it resolved to `gx10-9428.local`, `192.168.0.105`, port 8000, with all five TXT records. |
| Which interfaces does Avahi advertise on? | All of them: the Wi-Fi interface, loopback, both Docker bridges and every container veth. mDNS is per link, so LAN clients see only the Wi-Fi record. |
| Is the model server already reachable from the LAN? | Yes: `http://192.168.0.105:8000/v1/models` answers 200 (it binds `0.0.0.0:8000`, accepted by design). |
| What else listens beyond loopback? | Nothing of Puffin's. The web UI (3000, 80), SearXNG (8888), Gmail (8767), image search (8768), speech-to-text (8100) and the diffusion sidecar (8001) are all on `127.0.0.1`. |
| Does the web UI accept a non-localhost `Host`? | Yes: `/app` answers 200 for `Host: 192.168.0.105:3000` and `Host: gx10-9428.local:3000` as for `localhost:3000`. |
| Do the model containers come back after a reboot with nobody logged in? | Their restart policy is `unless-stopped` (model server, SearXNG, nginx). The user's systemd lingering is **off**, so a user unit would not run before login. |
| Can Codex be built for the client platforms? | Upstream's release workflows build `aarch64`/`x86_64` for `apple-darwin` and `unknown-linux-musl`, and `x86_64`/`aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` in a separate Windows workflow. The pinned V8 manifests (`third_party/v8/rusty_v8_150_4_0_release_manifests.sha256`) list pointer-compression-and-sandbox builds for all of them plus `linux-gnu`. Read from the submodule; **never built here**. |
| Do the index tools exist for the client platforms? | codebase-memory-mcp v0.11.0 ships `darwin-amd64`, `darwin-arm64`, `linux-amd64` and `linux-arm64`; a Windows asset was seen only for its UI build. The scip CLI v0.10.0 ships `darwin` and `linux`, both architectures, and **no Windows build**. |

Read on the web, not tested here:
- **A page served from `http://<LAN address>` is not a secure context**, so `navigator.mediaDevices` is undefined and the microphone button cannot work; `http://localhost` is exempt (MDN).
- **macOS 15 and later gate local-network access per application.** A bundled app must declare `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` and `NSBonjourServices` or its multicast and unicast LAN traffic fails silently with no prompt (Apple TN3179, as reported by several projects).
- **`mdns-sd`** is a pure-Rust mDNS/DNS-SD implementation for Linux, macOS and Windows with no async runtime.

Not checked, and so the first work of Part 1 (Phase 0 in §14):
- any build of `puffin`, `puffin-code` or `puffin-app` on macOS or Windows;
- whether Avahi publishes a file in `/etc/avahi/services/` that the node's user, not root, owns (§5.2);
- whether a command-line `puffin` started from Terminal on macOS inherits Terminal's local-network grant;
- `mdns-sd` browsing beside Avahi, Bonjour and Windows' own resolver;
- SearXNG answering JSON to a non-loopback client (its bot limiter may treat LAN addresses differently);
- the web UI's streaming and voice traffic through a loopback proxy.

## 3. The two halves

| Component | Today | Client | Node |
|---|---|---|---|
| `puffin` (terminal agent) and `codex-code-mode-host` | Rust, linux-arm64 | ✔ | ✔ (a GB10 has both halves) |
| `puffin-search`, `puffin-fetch` | Rust | ✔ | ✔ |
| `puffin-code` (code index) and its pinned tools | Rust, tools installed by `puffin-admin code setup` | ✔, tools installed by `puffin-code setup` (§8.3) | ✔ |
| `puffin-app` (desktop window) | Tauri, Linux | ✔ | ✔ |
| Model server (SGLang or vLLM), diffusion sidecar | Docker | | ✔ |
| SearXNG, speech-to-text, image search, Gmail service | Docker sidecars | | ✔ |
| Web UI (Onyx Lite stack) | Docker | | ✔ |
| `puffin-admin` (Python): `server`, `model`, `puffin`, `night`, `swe-bench`, `audit`, `mcp`, … | Python package | | ✔ |
| Host safety, PSI watchdog | Python | | ✔ |

**Where the user's code lives.** On the client. The agent's shell commands, its sandbox, the git repository and the code index all run on the client machine; only prompts and completions cross the network. That is why indexing is a client component and why Night Shift is not (§10).

**Web access is split.** `puffin-search` asks the node's SearXNG, so search queries leave for the internet from the node. `puffin-fetch` fetches pages itself, from the client. `/airgapped` levels are resolved on the client, as now.

---

## 4. What leaves loopback on the node

A node that is not advertised keeps today's binds. `puffin-admin node enable` (§5.2) is what changes them, and `node disable` puts them back.

| Service | Bind today | After `node enable` | Who needs it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model server, 8000 | `0.0.0.0` | unchanged | `puffin` on every client |
| Web UI (nginx), 3000 | `127.0.0.1` | `0.0.0.0` | `puffin-app`, and a plain browser, on clients |
| Web UI (nginx), 80 | `127.0.0.1` | unchanged | nobody remote |
| SearXNG, 8888 | `127.0.0.1` | `0.0.0.0` | `puffin-search` on clients |
| Gmail service, 8767 | `127.0.0.1` | unchanged | node only (§10) |
| Diffusion sidecar, 8001 | `127.0.0.1` | unchanged | node only |
| Speech-to-text 8100, image search 8768 | `127.0.0.1` | unchanged | the web UI's own containers |

**This reverses two fixes of 2026-09-29**, deliberately:
- nginx had been published on every interface, which put the web UI's default admin account on the LAN; `configure()` bound it to loopback.
- SearXNG was loopback-only.

Under the trusted-LAN decision both become "accepted by design" on an advertised node. When this is implemented the two rows move to that table in [README](./README.md) with the date and this reason; they are not silently reopened. Mechanically: `HOST_PORT=0.0.0.0:3000` in the web UI's `.env` (the variable `bind_to_loopback()` already writes) and the SearXNG sidecar's publish address, both keyed on one config value, `node_advertise`.

**What that exposes, stated plainly** (§11 has the rest):
- **The web UI has one account**, `admin@dreamference.dev` with a published default password. Every person on the LAN who opens it shares one chat history and the admin panel.
- **The web UI's Gmail tool reads the node owner's mail.** Anyone on the LAN using the web UI can ask it to search that mail. `puffin-admin node enable --no-web` leaves the web UI on loopback for an owner who wants remote `puffin` but not a shared web UI (question 2).

---

## 5. Discovery

### 5.1 The service

- **Type:** `_puffin-node._tcp` (the name is 11 characters; DNS-SD allows 15).
- **Instance name:** the host name (`gx10-9428`).
- **Port (SRV):** the model server's, 8000.
- **TXT records:**

| Key | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `proto` | `1` | Version of this contract. A client refuses a node whose `proto` is higher than it knows. |
| `node` | `7c1e…` | The node's stable id, a UUID written once to `~/.config/dreamference/node-id`. It, not the address or the name, is what a client remembers. |
| `version` | `1.3.0` | Puffin's version on the node, for the skew notice (§6.5). |
| `web` | `3000` | Port of the web UI; absent when it is not shared. |
| `search` | `8888` | Port of SearXNG; absent when it is not shared. |
| `state` | `ready` | `stopped`, `loading` or `ready`. Written by `server start` when it launches the model (`loading`) and when `/v1/models` first answers (`ready`), and by `server stop`. It changes once per launch, not per request. |
| `main` | `1` | Present when the model assigned to the node is a chat model a coding client can use: any matrix entry that is not a diffusion, speech or embedding model. It is a property of the matrix entry, so nobody sets it. Used only to choose between several nodes (§12.3). |
| `control` | `8002` | Port of the node's control agent; absent unless the owner switched remote control on (§12.4). |

Nothing that changes from minute to minute is advertised. Which model is loaded and its context length are asked of the model server itself (`/v1/models`), which the launcher already does. `state` is advertised because the server cannot say it: SGLang opens its port only once the model is loaded, so a refused connection looks the same for a stopped node and a loading one.

### 5.2 The node side: a static Avahi service file

`puffin-admin node enable` writes `/etc/avahi/services/puffin-node.service` (Avahi watches that directory and publishes the file without a restart), sets `node_advertise`, and re-publishes the web UI and SearXNG on every interface. `node disable` removes the file and restores the loopback binds. `node status` prints the file's records, the binds, and what a browse of the local network returns.

- **Why a file and not a process.** A file needs no running publisher, so the node is advertised after a reboot with nobody logged in, like the model containers. A user unit holding the registration would need lingering, which is off here (§2).
- **Why Avahi and not a responder of our own.** The node already runs one. A second responder on the same host competes for port 5353 and for the host name.
- **It needs root once**, to create the file under `/etc/avahi` and hand its ownership to the node's user. The command is printed before it runs and `sudo` prompts on the terminal, the rule `puffin-admin desktop install` set. Where `sudo` cannot prompt, the file's content and destination are printed instead.
- **Later changes need no root.** The file holds the model port, the version and the `state`, `main` and `control` records. `server start`, `server stop` and an update rewrite it, as the user who owns it. That Avahi publishes a service file not owned by root is assumed, and is a Phase 0 check; if it does not, those commands say that `node enable` must be run again instead.
- **Interfaces.** Avahi advertises on the Docker bridges too (§2). That is harmless and is left alone: changing `allow-interfaces` would edit a system file other software reads.

### 5.3 The client side: `mdns-sd`

One code path on all three systems: the pure-Rust `mdns-sd` crate browses `_puffin-node._tcp.local.` for up to 2 s and stops at the first answer when it is looking for one remembered node.

- **Connect to the resolved address, never the `.local` name.** The browse answer carries the addresses. Resolving `gx10-9428.local` through the operating system depends on `nss-mdns` on Linux and is unreliable on Windows.
- **IPv4 first**, then IPv6 with its scope id; link-local IPv6 without a scope is dropped.
- **Only the launcher and `puffin-app` browse.** `puffin-search` and `puffin-code` read the file the launcher wrote (§6.2), so they need no multicast and work inside Codex's sandbox.
- **The alternative, the system's own DNS-SD** (Bonjour on macOS, the Win32 API, Avahi over D-Bus), is three code paths. It is kept in reserve for the case Phase 1 finds `mdns-sd` blocked where the native API is not, which is plausible on macOS (§8.2).

### 5.4 Rejected: a front-door proxy

A `puffin-node` daemon that advertises itself, serves a descriptor and reverse-proxies every service on one port would keep the sidecars on loopback and give one place for version and state. It was not chosen because it puts a new always-on process in the path of every token, needs supervising and restarting like the model server, and buys nothing the TXT records and the services' own ports do not already give. If per-client accounting or access rules are ever wanted, that is the place they would go.

---

## 6. Connecting

### 6.1 Order of resolution

`vllm_host()` in the launcher gains tiers. The first that yields a host wins:

1. `DREAMFERENCE_VLLM_HOST`.
2. `vllm_host` in `DREAMFERENCE_CONFIG_PATH`, `./dreamference.toml` or `~/.config/dreamference/config.toml`.
3. **This machine is a node** (`~/.config/dreamference/node-id` exists): `http://localhost:8000`, with no discovery at all. A GB10 never browses for itself.
4. **The remembered node** (`$CODEX_HOME/node.json`): a browse looks for its `node` id and stops at the first answer, typically well under a second, and the address in that answer is used. This is what survives a DHCP address change. Only when the browse returns **nothing at all** is the remembered address tried, with one line saying so. The order matters: the model server's own answers carry no node id, so trying the old address first would connect a laptop that has moved to another network to whatever answers there on port 8000.
5. **A browse.** One node found: it is used and remembered, with one line saying so. Several: §6.3. None: §6.4.

Tiers 1 and 2 are today's behaviour and still mean "I know where the server is". On the GB10 the checked-in `dreamference.toml` already names `localhost:8000`, so tier 2 answers there and nothing changes.

### 6.2 `node.json`

`$CODEX_HOME/node.json` (`~/.puffin/node.json`), written whole and atomically by the launcher:

```json
{ "node": "7c1e…", "name": "gx10-9428", "address": "192.168.0.105",
  "model_port": 8000, "web_port": 3000, "search_port": 8888,
  "version": "1.3.0", "last_seen": "2026-10-01T22:10:04+01:00" }
```

- A small std-only crate, `puffin-rs/node-locator/`, reads it and returns the endpoints. The launcher, `puffin-search`, `puffin-code` and `puffin-app` share it, the way `/airgapped`'s resolver is shared, with the same byte-identical-copy test for the web crate.
- `puffin-search` uses `http://<address>:<search_port>` when `DREAMFERENCE_SEARXNG_URL` is unset, the machine is not a node and the file exists; otherwise today's `127.0.0.1:8888`.
- **The remembered address is the fallback for blocked multicast.** Where a browse silently returns nothing (a guest Wi-Fi with client isolation, macOS without the local-network grant), a node used once, or set by hand, keeps working by address (tier 4).
- **The file is the agent's to write when a session's working directory is the home folder**, as `/airgapped`'s level files are: the workspace-write sandbox allows writes under the working directory. The "never adopted silently" rule of §6.3 is launcher logic that such a session could get round by rewriting the file. The check that `$CODEX_HOME` does not lie under a writable root, which the `/airgapped` spec lists as not yet built, covers both.

### 6.3 `puffin node`

A launcher subcommand, intercepted in `prepare_args` the way `night` is, so it costs no patch:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `puffin node` or `puffin node list` | Browses and lists every node: name, address, served model and context (asked of each), version, and which one is in use |
| `puffin node use <name\|address>` | Remembers that node. An address works with no mDNS at all |
| `puffin node forget` | Deletes `node.json`; the next start browses again |

There is no `/node` slash command: the patch series stands at 31,175 of 31,500 bytes.

**Several nodes and none remembered:** an interactive `puffin` lists them and asks which; `puffin exec` and other non-interactive commands refuse with the list and the `puffin node use` line. The client does not guess.

**The remembered node is gone and another is present:** the same rule. Prompts and source code go to whichever node is chosen, so a new one is never adopted silently.

### 6.4 Messages, not a ten-minute wait

Today the launcher prints dots for up to 600 s when the server does not answer. With discovery there are three distinct cases, each with its own text:

| Case | What the client says |
|---|---|
| No node found, none remembered | `No Puffin node found on this network.` then: start one on a GB10 (`puffin-admin server start`, `puffin-admin node enable`), or `puffin node use <address>` |
| Node found, `state=stopped` | `Node gx10-9428 found, but its model server is not running. On the node: puffin-admin server start` and no wait |
| Node found, `state=loading` | `Node gx10-9428: model loading` and today's dotted wait |
| Node found, `state=ready`, port refuses | The advert is stale (the server died without `server stop`): the first message, plus `puffin-admin status` on the node |

### 6.5 Version skew

- `proto` higher than the client knows: refuse, and name `puffin update`.
- `version` differs: one line, at most once a day, naming both versions. Nothing is blocked; the model API is the contract and it does not move with Puffin's version.

### 6.6 Every hard-coded address, and what it becomes

From the sources' outlines and a search on 2026-10-01; Phase 1 starts by repeating the search over the whole tree, since a constant missed here is a feature that silently talks to nothing on a client.

| Where | Today | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| `puffin-rs/src/lib.rs` `DEFAULT_VLLM_HOST` | `http://localhost:8000` | the last tier only; the locator's address before it (§6.1) |
| `puffin-rs/src/lib.rs` `GMAIL_SERVICE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8767` | unchanged, and asked only when this machine is a node (§10) |
| `puffin-rs/src/lib.rs` `OFFLINE_CHATGPT_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:9/…` | unchanged: it is a deliberate dead end |
| `puffin-rs/src/app.rs` `ONYX_WEB_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | unchanged; `puffin app` starts `puffin-app`, whose forwarder makes it true on a client (§7) |
| `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` window `url` | `http://localhost:3000/app` | unchanged, for the same reason |
| `puffin-web-rs/src/search.rs` `DEFAULT_SEARXNG_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8888` | the locator's address when not a node (§6.2) |
| `puffin-web-rs/src/search.rs` `SEARXNG_START_HINT` | `puffin-admin searxng start` | on a client: "on the node: …" |
| `puffin-code-rs/src/index/probe.rs` | asks the served model's `/metrics` whether it is busy, to freeze indexers | skipped when this machine is not a node: a remote model's load is no reason to pause a laptop's indexer (§8.3) |
| `puffin-rs/src/usage.rs` (`/usage`) | to be read in Phase 1: whether it asks the server or only local session files | the locator's address if it asks the server |

### 6.7 What the launcher writes

Unchanged in kind: the catalog and `config.toml` in `$CODEX_HOME`, with the provider's base URL now the node's address. `check_for_update_on_startup = false` and the `chatgpt_base_url` blackhole stay. The Gmail prompt block is added only when this machine is a node (§10).

---

## 7. `puffin-app` on a client

Two hard-coded addresses name `localhost:3000`: the window's `url` in `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `ONYX_WEB_URL` in `puffin-rs/src/app.rs`.

**Chosen design: a loopback forwarder inside the app.** On a machine that is not a node, `puffin-app` resolves the node (§6.1, with its own browse), binds `127.0.0.1:3000` and forwards every request, streamed response and WebSocket upgrade to `<address>:<web_port>`. The window keeps loading `http://localhost:3000/app`.

- **The origin stays `localhost`**, which is a secure context, so the microphone works; a window on `http://192.168.0.105:3000` would have no `navigator.mediaDevices` (§2).
- **Nothing about the web UI changes**: cookies, the Google sign-in redirect and every patch `configure` applies see the address they see today.
- **The `Host` header is passed through unchanged** (`localhost:3000`), so redirects and any absolute address the UI emits come back pointing at the forwarder. The web UI answers the same for any `Host` (§2), so nothing on the node has to know.
- **If port 3000 is taken** on the client, the app uses 33000 and says so in its title bar once; the saved session is per origin, so the port must not change from run to run.
- **On a node** the app does what it does now and starts no forwarder.
- **No node:** the app shows §6.4's first message in its own window, in place of a connection error.

**Signing in.** The web UI asks for its account. With no session, the app posts the default credentials to `/api/auth/login` once; if the node's owner changed the password, the normal login page appears. This keeps "no authentication required" true for the default install without removing the owner's ability to set a password.

**Rejected:**
- **HTTPS with a self-signed certificate on the node:** a trust prompt, or a certificate to distribute, on three operating systems.
- **Marking the origin as secure by a browser flag:** exists only in Chromium, and the app's engines are WebKitGTK, WKWebView and WebView2.

**A plain browser** on a client can open `http://<node>:3000` and use everything except the microphone.

## 8. The client on three systems

### 8.1 Builds

| Target | Agent and web commands | `puffin-code` | `puffin-app` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | today | today | `.deb`, AppImage (today) |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | new | new | `.deb`, AppImage |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | new | new | `.dmg` |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` | new, if Intel Macs are wanted (question 5) | new | `.dmg` |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | new | universal layer only, if at all (§8.3) | `.msi` |

- **The builder runs on each platform's CI runner.** `CodexBrandedBuilder` is Python and uses `git archive`, `git apply` and Cargo, none of them Linux-only; `fetch_rusty_v8()` already names the asset by target. Python is needed to *build* the client, never to run it.
- **Windows ships more than one executable.** Upstream's Windows workflow builds `codex-windows-sandbox-setup`, `codex-windows-sandbox-service` and `codex-command-runner` beside `codex`; the Windows package carries them next to `puffin.exe`.
- **Known Linux assumptions to remove:** `puffin update` returns early unless `target_os = "linux"`; `puffin app` finds the window through a `.desktop` entry. (Vendored OpenSSL is already scoped to glibc Linux in the launcher's manifest, so macOS and Windows build against what upstream uses there.)
- **`$CODEX_HOME`** is `~/.puffin` everywhere (`%USERPROFILE%\.puffin` on Windows).

### 8.2 What each system changes

| | Ubuntu | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| Command sandbox | bubblewrap, as on the node | Seatbelt (Codex's own) | Codex's Windows sandbox |
| `/airgapped on` enforced by the kernel | yes (patch `0019` hooks the Linux sandbox helper) | **no: cooperative only** | **no: cooperative only** |
| Discovery | `mdns-sd` | `mdns-sd`; local-network permission applies (below) | `mdns-sd`; Windows Firewall may ask once for UDP 5353 |
| Installer | `.deb` / script | script, `.dmg` for the app | PowerShell script, `.msi` for the app |

- **`/airgapped` off Linux.** The `on` level's guarantee comes from three lines in `linux-sandbox`. On macOS and Windows the level still switches off `puffin-search` and `puffin-fetch` and still tells the model, but a command can reach the network. `/airgapped` must print that on those systems, as it already prints its other holes. Extending the hook to Seatbelt and the Windows sandbox is that spec's work, and costs patch bytes.
- **macOS local-network permission.** `puffin-app`'s bundle declares `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` and `NSBonjourServices` (`_puffin-node._tcp`), or the browse and the forwarder both fail silently. For `puffin` in a terminal the grant belongs to the terminal application; whether that covers multicast from a child process is unverified. If it does not, macOS falls back to the system's own DNS-SD (§5.3) or to `puffin node use <address>`.
- **Unsigned binaries.** A script that downloads with `curl` sets no quarantine flag, so the command-line tools run unsigned. A `.dmg` or `.msi` opened from a browser meets Gatekeeper or SmartScreen; signing needs an Apple Developer ID and a Windows code-signing certificate (question 4).

### 8.3 Indexing on a client

`puffin-code` answers queries the same way everywhere: it reads SQLite files. What differs is running the indexers.

- **Installing the tools.** `puffin-admin code setup` is Python. `puffin-code setup` does the same in Rust: the pinned codebase-memory-mcp and scip CLI for the platform, checked against their published checksums, plus the npm indexers when Node is present. `puffin-admin code setup` on a node calls it.
- **Linux clients:** as on the node, every indexer in a `systemd-run` scope inside bubblewrap. Without a systemd user bus (a container, WSL) a request is queued and nothing starts, which is today's behaviour.
- **macOS and Windows have neither `systemd-run` nor bubblewrap.** In this version:
  - indexers that only read source run unsandboxed: codebase-memory, scip-python, scip-typescript, scip-go;
  - indexers that execute the project's build (rust-analyzer, scip-java, scip-dotnet) **do not run**, and `puffin-code status` names them as skipped and why. The reason for their sandbox, a hostile build script, does not go away on a laptop.
- **Windows:** the scip CLI has no Windows build, so there is no exact layer; the universal layer depends on a Windows build of codebase-memory-mcp, which was not confirmed (§2). Until it is, `puffin-code` on Windows answers by text search only and says so.
- **The memory budget changes meaning.** On a node it protects the model server. On a client with no model server it is a plain cap (a quarter of RAM), and the freeze-while-the-model-is-busy rule does not apply.
- **`puffin-code session`** is started by the launcher and uses the systemd user bus; off Linux it runs the static indexers as ordinary child processes at low priority.

## 9. Installing

One entry point per system, and the machine decides the role:

| Machine | Installs | How it is decided |
|---|---|---|
| GB10 (DGX Spark) | node **and** client, then `puffin-admin node enable` | a shell check in the installer, which runs before any Python exists on a fresh machine: `uname -m` is `aarch64` and the GPU name from `nvidia-smi` (or the board model under `/proc/device-tree`) names the GB10. The Python detection in `dreamference/hardware/` confirms it during `node enable` |
| Any other Linux, macOS, Windows | client only | everything else |

- **`install.sh`** (Linux and macOS) and **`install.ps1`** (Windows) download the release assets for the machine's target, verify them against the release's checksum file and place them in `~/.local/share/dreamference/puffin/bin` (or the platform's equivalent) with links on `PATH`. This is the path `puffin update` already implements for linux-arm64; `asset_names()` grows `puffin-code`, and the release workflow grows the matrix of §8.1.
- **On a GB10** the script then does today's node install (the Python package, `puffin-admin`, the model) and runs `node enable`, which is where `sudo` is asked for, once and visibly.
- **`--role client|node|both`** overrides the detection, for a GB10 that should only be a client of another, and for tests.
- **A node without the client is not offered.** The node's own tools (`night run`, `swe-bench`, `audit egress`) run `puffin`.
- **Updating.** `puffin update` on a client updates the client. On a node it updates the client binaries as now; the Python half is updated as it is today.

---

## 10. What works from a remote client

| Feature | Remote client | Why, when not |
|---|---|---|
| `puffin`, `puffin exec`, resume, `/cavemode`, `/usage` | yes | |
| `puffin-search` | yes, through the node's SearXNG | |
| `puffin-fetch` | yes, from the client | |
| `puffin-code` | yes, with the per-system limits of §8.3 | |
| `puffin-app`, including voice | yes | forwarder (§7) |
| `/airgapped` | yes; `on` is kernel-enforced on Linux only | §8.2 |
| Gmail in `puffin` (`puffin-admin gmail`) | **no** | The command is Python, and the service's shared secret is a file on the node. The launcher adds the Gmail block to the prompt only on a node; a remote client never sees a command it cannot run |
| `/night` and Night Shift | **no** | The queue is on the machine where `/night add` ran, and the runner is `puffin-admin` on the node. On a client `/night` answers that Night Shift runs on the node, in place of queueing tasks nothing will run. Part 3's follow-up (§13.3) is what would change this |
| `puffin-admin` anything (`server`, `model`, `swe-bench`, `audit egress`, `mcp`) | **no** | Node only. Managing a node is done from a node (§12.4) |
| Cline, Continue, OpenHands | by hand | `puffin node list` prints the model URL to paste into them |

These are scoped out of Part 1, not designed around. The one that will be asked for first is Night Shift for a repository on a laptop; sending the task to the node as a job (§13) is the route to it.

**Several clients share one node's cache.** The model server's KV pool holds about 157K tokens for all sessions together, while each session is told the context is 262K ([PUFFIN_COMPACTION](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_COMPACTION.md)). With one user that gap was theoretical. Lowering the compaction limit to follow the pool, which that spec proposes, should land before more than one person uses a node.

---

## 11. Threat model

Stated so the trade is visible, not to reopen it:

- **Anyone on the local network can use the node**: send prompts to the model, search through its SearXNG, and (unless `--no-web`) use the web UI with its one account, its chat history and its Gmail tool.
- **Nothing is encrypted.** Prompts, source code in them and completions cross the LAN in clear text.
- **mDNS can be spoofed.** A device on the LAN that advertises `_puffin-node._tcp` would be offered as a node, and a client that chose it would send it prompts and code. The guard is the rule of §6.3: a node is remembered by id, and a different one is never adopted without the user choosing it. That is protection against accidents, not against an attacker on the LAN, who by the trusted-LAN assumption is not there.
- **Nothing new reaches the internet.** Discovery is multicast on the local link, and a client's traffic goes to the node's LAN address. The egress audit runs only on a node, where `puffin` uses loopback (tier 3), so its allow-list does not change; the check that matters is that it still passes with `node enable` on (§16). If the audit is ever run from a client, the node's address and its three ports join the allow-list.
- **A node that should not be shared is not advertised.** Without `node enable` every bind stays as it is today.

---

## 12. Part 2: several nodes

A second DGX Spark beside the first, managed from either. Nothing in §3–§9 depends on this section.

### 12.1 What NVIDIA documents

- **The hardware link.** Each Spark has two QSFP ports on a ConnectX-7 NIC; NVIDIA's "Connect Two Sparks" playbook links two units with one QSFP cable for a direct 200GbE connection, configures the interfaces with netplan and sets up passwordless SSH between the nodes (read from the playbook's summary page; its step-by-step text was not retrieved).
- **Splitting a model** across the pair is done, in NVIDIA's and the community's guides, with vLLM on a Ray backend, the weights partitioned by tensor or pipeline parallelism and activations exchanged over the QSFP link on every forward pass.
- **Measured by others** (StorageReview, two Sparks, GPT-OSS-120B, batch 128): 555 tok/s with pipeline parallelism against 252 with tensor parallelism, and the order reversed on an 8B model. Those are batched-throughput figures; they say nothing about one interactive stream.

### 12.2 Two topologies, and which comes first

| | (a) Independent nodes | (b) One model split across both |
|---|---|---|
| What each Spark runs | a whole model, by its own recipe | half of one model |
| Good for | throughput (a replica: more Night Shift and SWE-bench tasks at once); a second model (the 122B fallback, a fast-tools model, embeddings, speech) | a model that does not fit in 128 GB |
| Engine | whatever the recipe names, including SGLang with DFlash2 | vLLM with Ray; none of Puffin's recipes is written for it |
| If one Spark fails | the other keeps serving | the model is down |
| Host safety | each node's own checks and watchdog, unchanged | a load pins memory on both hosts at once, and a watchdog trip on either must stop both halves |
| Network needed | the ordinary LAN | the QSFP link |

**(a) is supported first, and is the only one this spec designs.** Every model in the matrix fits on one GB10, the default model runs on an engine that has no split mode here, and (a) reuses everything that exists. **(b) is recorded as not planned:** it becomes worth a spec of its own only for a model that needs more than 128 GB, and it would need a Ray-based recipe, a joint pre-flight and a joint kill path that do not exist.

The QSFP link is still useful under (a): copying a model's files from one Spark's cache to the other at 200GbE in place of a second download. `puffin-admin node sync-model <name> <model>` over that link is an optional extra, not a dependency.

### 12.3 Discovery and choice with more than one node

- **Every node is installed the same way and advertises itself** exactly as in §5. A browse returns all of them. No node knows about the others, and none is told it is first or second.
- **A client still uses one node per session.** `puffin node list` shows each node's model, context and current load (`/v1/models` and `/metrics`, which are already open). `puffin node use` pins one; `PUFFIN_NODE=<name>` picks for one command.
- **Unprompted choice**, with nothing remembered and several nodes: the one advertising `main=1` is used and remembered. Only when none, or more than one, is marked does §6.3's "list and ask" apply, once, and the answer is remembered. Two Sparks with a coding model on one and speech, embeddings or a diffusion model on the other therefore need no decision from anyone; two Sparks that both serve a coding model need one answer, once per client.
- **A session stays on its node.** The server's prefix cache is per node (a new session reuses about 11K cached prompt tokens, measured 2026-10-01), so moving a session between replicas throws that away. There is no load balancer; spreading is done by whatever starts many sessions.
- **Night Shift and SWE-bench** are where a replica pays: the runner computes parallelism per node from that node's KV pool and gives each task a node. That is a change to those runners, listed here and specified there.

### 12.4 Managing one node from another

**There is no primary.** "The primary" is whichever machine a person is sitting at when they type `puffin-admin node …`. It discovers the nodes by the same browse a client uses and sends commands to the one named. A role stored at install time was rejected: the question means nothing with one Spark, can be answered wrongly, has to be redone when machines are swapped, and creates states (two primaries, none) that then need handling.

`puffin-admin node`, run on any node:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `node list` | every node on the network: name, assigned and loaded model, load, memory, whether it accepts control |
| `node status <name>` | that node's `puffin-admin status` |
| `node set <name> --model <key>` | assigns a model to that node and starts it there |
| `node stop <name>` / `node start <name>` | stops, or starts again, the model server there |
| `node control on\|off` | on **this** node: whether it accepts the three commands above from other machines |

- **Status needs no control channel.** Model, load and KV pool come from each node's open model port.
- **Each node keeps its own assignment.** `node set` stores the model key in that node's own config (the existing `model` key), so the node comes back with it after a reboot without the other machine being up. Nothing on the commanding machine has to be remembered, so there is no shared state to fall out of step.
- **Every load is executed by the node that carries it.** The command carries a model key and nothing else; the node runs its own `puffin-admin server start`, with its own `check_host_safety()`, its own memory pre-flight and its own PSI watchdog. Nothing sent from outside can skip them. A refusal comes back as that node's own message.
- **Only keys of the node's own model matrix are accepted**, never a repository name.

**What "trusted LAN, no authentication" means for control.** Inference open to the LAN means anyone on it can *use* the node. Control open to the LAN means anyone on it can stop the model under someone's session, start a load (the one operation that can freeze a unified-memory host, which is why host safety exists), or make a node download tens of gigabytes. That is a different class from sending a prompt, so it gets its own switch.

**Chosen: a per-node switch, off until the owner turns it on, and then open to the LAN.**
- `puffin-admin node control on`, typed once on the node being offered, starts a small control agent there (a user service, port 8002, advertised in the `control` TXT record) with exactly three operations: status, set-model-and-start, stop. It is the only new process in this spec, it runs only where switched on, and it is never in the path of a token.
- With it on, no key, password or pairing is needed: any machine on the LAN can run `node set` against it. That is the trusted-LAN decision applied to control, by a deliberate act at the node's own keyboard.
- With it off, which is the state of a single-Spark install, the node can be changed only from its own shell, as today.
- The agent needs lingering to run before anyone logs in; `node control on` says so, as `night enable` does.

**The stricter alternative is SSH**, the commanding machine running `ssh <node> puffin-admin …`. NVIDIA's two-Spark setup already establishes passwordless SSH between the units, it adds no listening service, and it authenticates control by key. It costs a key exchange the user has to do. It stays available without any code of Puffin's, and the spec does not build on it because the stated aim is the least setup; question 3 asks whether that trade is right.

**If topology (b) is ever built**, the same no-roles rule applies: the Ray head is the node the launch is typed on, chosen at each launch, not stored.

### 12.5 Alternatives considered

- **A container orchestrator (Docker Swarm, k3s, Nomad).** They decide where containers run and move them when a machine fails. A model server that pins most of a host's memory, takes minutes to load and must pass that host's safety checks is not something to reschedule automatically, and with two machines there is nothing to schedule. They also bring a control plane, join tokens and their own networking: more to set up than the whole of this spec.
- **exo.** Worth citing for what it gets right: devices find each other on the local network with no configuration and no designated leader, which is the experience this spec copies for discovery. Its purpose is topology (b), partitioning one model across unlike devices with its own inference engines, which is not what Puffin's recipes run on.
- **GPUStack.** The closest existing product: a server that workers register with, which then places models on them behind one OpenAI-compatible endpoint, with vLLM among its backends. It has what this spec deliberately leaves out: a stored server/worker role, registration tokens, a scheduler and a gateway in the request path. It would replace Puffin's launch recipes and host-safety layer, not sit beside them.
- **What is used instead:** mDNS for finding nodes, each node's existing ports for using it, and a three-operation agent for managing it.

Neither exo nor GPUStack was installed or measured here; the descriptions are from their documentation.

## 13. Part 3: running jobs on another node

Sending work to a node: a script, or an agent task of Night Shift's kind. It comes after Parts 1 and 2 and delays neither. With one Spark here, nothing in this section could be run between two machines; §13.8 says what was checked.

### 13.1 Decisions

1. **The transport is SSH, not the open node API.** An unauthenticated "run this" endpoint would be remote code execution for every device on the network. Sending prompts to a model, and even stopping one (§12.4), are things the trusted-LAN decision can carry; running arbitrary programs as the node's user is not. SSH is already listening on the node (§13.8), and NVIDIA's two-Spark setup establishes passwordless SSH between the units anyway.
2. **The user never types an SSH command.** `puffin-admin node add <node>` sets the key up once (§13.2).
3. **The job model is Night Shift's**, pointed at another machine: a git worktree per job, a memory-capped scope, a time limit, tests, and a branch plus a report as the only output ([PUFFIN_NIGHT_SHIFT](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_NIGHT_SHIFT.md), including its §11).
4. **Code travels by git.** The commit is pushed to the node, the job runs in a worktree there, and the resulting branch is fetched back. Nothing lands in the user's checkout until they merge.
5. **Admission and host safety are the working node's.** The sender asks; the node that would carry the load decides, with its own checks.
6. **Remote jobs do not inherit Night Shift's sandbox gap.** They run inside a sandbox on the node (§13.5), test command and plain scripts included.

### 13.2 Pairing: `puffin-admin node add`

- `puffin-admin node add <node>` finds the node by the browse of §5, creates a key used for nothing else (`~/.ssh/puffin-node_ed25519`), and installs its public half on the node. That one step needs the node's password, typed once at `ssh-copy-id`'s own prompt; there is no way to authorise a key without authenticating once.
- **The key is restricted on the node** to one forced command, `puffin-admin node serve-job`, with no terminal, no port forwarding and no agent forwarding. It can push to the job repositories and ask for jobs; it cannot open a shell. That is what makes the caps of §13.4 mandatory: a raw `ssh <node> python train.py` with this key is refused.
- **How git gets through a forced command.** `sshd` ignores the command the client asked for and runs `serve-job`, passing the request in `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND`. `serve-job` runs `git-receive-pack` or `git-upload-pack` itself when the request is one of those two for a path under the job repositories, handles its own job operations, and refuses everything else. This is the pattern gitolite uses.
- **The node's host key is pinned to its `node` id** at `node add`, so a different machine answering at the same address later is refused, not trusted.
- `puffin-admin node remove <node>` deletes the key on both sides.
- **Once this exists, control (§12.4) can ride it.** A paired node could accept `node set` and `node stop` through the same restricted key, which would make the open control agent unnecessary between paired Sparks. Whether to keep the agent at all is decided when Part 3 is built (question 3).

### 13.3 What the user types

```bash
# A script, in the current repository at HEAD, on another node; output streams back.
puffin-admin node run spark-2 -- python train.py --epochs 3
puffin-admin node run spark-2 --memory 16G --time 2h --test "pytest -q" -- python train.py

puffin-admin node jobs [<node>]          # running and finished jobs
puffin-admin node logs <job>             # the output again, or from where it stopped
puffin-admin node cancel <job>
puffin-admin node fetch <job>            # bring the result branch into this repository
```

```text
/night add --on spark-2 Fix the flaky test in tests/test_sync.py
```

- **`node run`** pushes `HEAD`, runs the command in a fresh worktree of it on the node, streams the output, and at the end commits what `git status` shows on `job/<id>` and fetches that branch. With no change there is no branch, only the log and the exit code.
- **Large outputs are not committed.** What is committed is what git would track, Night Shift's rule, with the same caveat for a repository whose `.gitignore` misses something. A script that writes checkpoints or other artifacts names `--out <path>`; that folder is kept under the job's directory on the node and brought back by `node fetch` as files, never as a commit.
- **`/night add --on <node>`** records the node with the task. At night the local runner hands that task to the named node, whose own runner works it with its own `puffin exec` against **its own** model server over loopback, so two Sparks work one queue at once without sharing a model. The result branch `night/<id>` is fetched back and the morning report lists the task with the node it ran on. The flag is parsed in `puffin-rs/src/night.rs`; it needs no patch.
- **Uncommitted changes are not sent**, and the command says so, as `/night add` does.
- **Files that are not in git do not travel**: datasets, model weights, a local `.env`. A job that needs them names a path that exists on the node (§13.6).
- **The sender is a node in this version.** `puffin-admin` is Python, so a laptop cannot yet send jobs. The pieces a client would need are small (git, ssh, and the two commands above in the launcher), and adding them is what would close §10's Night Shift gap for repositories on a laptop. It is listed as the follow-up, not designed here.

### 13.4 Limits, admission and host safety

- **Every job has a memory cap and a time limit, with no way to send one without them.** Defaults are Night Shift's (`task_memory` 8 GiB, `task_timeout` 90 min); `--memory` and `--time` change them up to ceilings the *node's* config sets.
- **Admission runs on the working node**, at the moment the job would start: Night Shift's checks (model server answering if the job is an agent task, host-safety checks, free memory above the reserve plus the job's cap, no build, index run or night run in the way). A refusal comes back as that node's message. The sender's own state is irrelevant.
- **A memory cap does not bound GPU memory on a GB10.** Measured here: the model server's container reports 3.84 GiB to its cgroup while its process holds 53.8 GB of GPU memory. A script that allocates through CUDA is therefore outside its cap, on a machine where GPU and host memory are the same pool. For jobs:
  - a job is CPU-only unless sent with `--gpu`, and a CPU-only job is started with the GPU hidden (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` and no device nodes in its sandbox);
  - a `--gpu` job is admitted against free memory with the model server's needs counted, runs under the node's PSI watchdog as a model load does, and by default requires the node's model server to be stopped. Running a training script beside a resident model is the case host safety exists to prevent.
- **Interactive use still wins** on the working node, by Night Shift's rule.

### 13.5 Sandbox

Night Shift's known gap is that the runner's own test run executes agent-written code with the user's full rights ([PUFFIN_NIGHT_SHIFT §6](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_NIGHT_SHIFT.md)). On one's own machine that equals running the tests oneself in the morning. On another node it would hand code written by a model, or sent from another machine, the node owner's home folder: model caches, the Gmail service's secret, SSH keys.

- **Every remote job runs inside bubblewrap on the node**, the profile `puffin-code` already uses for indexers: the system read-only, the home folder an empty tmpfs, the job's worktree and its environment directory (§13.6) bound in, and a scratch `/tmp`. This covers plain scripts, the agent's session (in addition to Codex's own sandbox) and the runner's test command.
- **Each job has its own `CODEX_HOME`**, `~/.puffin/jobs/<id>/home`, bound read-write into every `puffin exec` of that job and nothing else of the home folder. Night Shift's nudges and resumed tasks call `puffin exec resume <session>`, and the session files have to be there on the second call; a fresh tmpfs each time would lose them, and the node owner's real `~/.puffin` (their sessions, their `node.json`) must not be what the job's agent sees. The launcher rewrites the catalog and config on every start, so nothing is missing from a new one.
- **The `/airgapped` level travels with the job.** The job record carries the sender's level, the node applies the stricter of that and its own, and the result is written as the level file in the job's `CODEX_HOME`. What it means differs by kind of job:
  - **A plain script, or the runner's test command:** at `on` the sandbox has no network at all.
  - **An agent task keeps the host's network namespace**, because `puffin exec` has to reach the node's model server on loopback, which a sandbox with its own network namespace cannot. The agent's commands are confined as on any node: Codex's own sandbox runs each of them, and patch `0019` removes the network there at `on`.
- **`--gpu` adds the GPU's device nodes** to the sandbox. Whether CUDA works inside that profile is unverified.
- **The same wrapper would close the gap for local Night Shift**, which is that spec's change to make, not this one's.

### 13.6 Dependencies

A worktree on another machine has no virtualenv, and Night Shift's fallback (the main checkout's `.venv`) does not exist there.

- **Nothing is installed implicitly.** A job that needs an environment says how to build it: `--setup "<command>"`, or `[night] setup` in the repository's `dreamference.toml`.
- **The setup command runs once per repository and per content of its lock files**, inside the sandbox, with the network unless the level is `on`, and its result is kept under `~/.puffin/jobs/envs/` on the node and bound into later jobs read-only.
- **With no setup command** the job runs with the node's system interpreter, and the report says so; a test run that fails on imports is reported as an environment failure, not as a failing test.
- **Data a job needs** is named by a path on the node and bound read-only with `--bind <path>`; the node's config lists which paths may be bound.

### 13.7 When the sender disconnects

- **A job is a unit on the node, not a child of the SSH connection.** `node run` streaming its output is a view; closing the laptop lid, or losing the network, does not stop the job.
- **That holds only with lingering on.** Jobs are user units, and with lingering off the user's service manager stops when their last session ends, taking a job started over SSH with it. Lingering is off on this machine (§2). `node add` checks `loginctl show-user <user> -p Linger` on the node and, if it is off, says to run `loginctl enable-linger` there: the same dependency `night enable` and the control agent (§12.4) already name.
- **Output is kept on the node** (`~/.puffin/jobs/<id>/`), and `node logs` reads it again or continues from where the stream stopped.
- **The result waits there** as a branch in the node's copy of the repository until `node fetch`, or for a night task until the sender's runner next looks. If the sender is off in the morning, the report line appears when it next starts.
- **Only `node cancel`, the time limit, the memory cap or the node's watchdog stop a job.**
- **Finished jobs are pruned** after they are fetched, and unfetched ones after 14 days, with `node jobs` showing what is about to go.

### 13.8 Checked here, and assumed

| | |
|---|---|
| SSH is listening on the node | Yes, on every interface, port 22 |
| Passwordless SSH to it exists already | No: `ssh -o BatchMode=yes localhost` is refused (`publickey,password`), so pairing has to create it |
| The tools are present | `git`, `bwrap` and `ssh-copy-id` are installed |
| A cgroup memory cap bounds GPU memory | **No** (3.84 GiB charged against 53.8 GB held), which is why §13.4 treats GPU jobs separately |
| Everything between two machines | **Not run.** There is one Spark here. Push, remote worktree, fetch, the restricted key, a job surviving a dropped connection and two nodes working one queue are designed from Night Shift's single-machine behaviour and are the first things to test when a second node exists |
| Lingering, which jobs need to outlive the sender's connection | **Off** on this machine (`Linger=no`) |
| CUDA inside the bubblewrap profile; a restricted key carrying `git push`; Codex's own bubblewrap sandbox nested inside the job's | Assumed |

---

## 14. Phases

| Part | Phase | Work | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|

## 15. Decided, and still open

### 15.1 Decided by the user on 2026-10-02

These settle the corresponding questions below; where an earlier section says otherwise, this list wins and the section is to be brought into line when the part is built.

- **The web UI is shared with the whole LAN by default** (question 2). `puffin-admin node enable` publishes it; `--no-web` remains for a node whose owner does not want that. The spec's warning stands and is printed at `node enable`: the UI has one account and can search the node owner's mail.
- **Control between nodes uses the SSH pairing, not an open switch** (question 3). §12.4's per-node switch that lets any LAN machine set or stop a node's model is dropped. Managing a node from another (`puffin-admin node set|stop|status <node>`) goes over the pairing of §13.2, so pairing (`puffin-admin node add`) moves forward from Part 3 into Part 2. Inference stays open on the trusted LAN; only control needs the key.
- **Installers are not signed** (question 4). The first-open warning on macOS and Windows is documented with the steps to get past it; no certificates are bought.
- **Windows is supported natively** (question 6), not through WSL (first answered "WSL" and corrected the same day). The native client of §8 is built: the Windows targets, Codex's Windows sandbox executables, and mDNS discovery working as on the other systems. Its known cost stays as §8 states it: no exact code index on Windows, because the scip CLI has no Windows build, so `puffin-code` answers from the universal layer there. WSL is not a supported install path; nothing prevents it, and discovery there would need `puffin node use <address>`.
- **GPU jobs beside a resident model are not allowed, for now** (question 8). No override is built; a GPU job needs the node's model server stopped.

### 15.2 Still open

1. **Should a `puffin-node` executable exist**, as an alias for `puffin-admin` on a node, or is the name only the role and the advertised service?
2. *(Decided, §15.1.)* **Is the web UI meant to be shared with the whole LAN by default?** It has one account and can search the node owner's mail. The alternative default is `node enable --no-web`, with `puffin-app` on other machines switched on deliberately.
3. *(Decided, §15.1.)* **Control between nodes.** Part 2 chooses a per-node switch that, once on, lets any LAN machine set or stop that node's model with no key (§12.4). Part 3 introduces an SSH pairing for jobs (§13.2) that could carry control as well. Keep the open switch for its simplicity, or drop it once pairing exists?
4. *(Decided, §15.1.)* **Signing.** Without an Apple Developer ID and a Windows code-signing certificate, `puffin-app` installers show a warning on first open. Buy them, or document the warning?
5. **Which client targets matter?** Intel Macs and Windows on ARM each add a build and a test machine.
6. *(Decided, §15.1.)* **Windows natively, or WSL?** Native costs the items of §8 (sandbox executables, no exact code index). Under WSL the Linux client runs unchanged, but mDNS does not cross WSL's default NAT, so discovery would be `puffin node use <address>`.
7. **Gmail from a remote client.** Out of scope here. Wanted at all, given that it would let every LAN client read one person's mail?
8. *(Decided, §15.1.)* **GPU jobs beside a resident model** (§13.4). The default refuses them unless the node's model server is stopped. Is there a case, such as a small fine-tune beside the 27B, worth an override?
9. **Sending jobs from a laptop** (§13.3). Wanted soon enough to put the sender in the Rust launcher in Part 3, or after it?
10. **Should a non-GB10 Linux machine with a capable GPU be allowed as a node** behind `--role node`? Host safety and every recipe are written for the GB10.

## 16. Tests

Offline, with no network and no real Avahi:
- **Launcher:** each resolution tier in order, with a stand-in browser; a node machine never browses; the remembered node is found again by id at a new address; several nodes and none remembered refuses in `exec`; a different node is never adopted silently; each message of §6.4; `proto` too new is refused; `puffin node list/use/forget`; `node.json` written whole.
- **Locator crate:** the web crate's copy is byte-identical; `puffin-search` picks the node's SearXNG only when the machine is not a node and no override is set.
- **`puffin-admin node`:** the service file's exact text for a given port, id, version, `main` and `control`; `enable` and `disable` change the two binds and nothing else, with `sudo` and `docker` mocked (the suite must not write `/etc` or touch a running container); staleness is reported by `server start --port` and by an update.
- **`puffin-app`:** the forwarder passes a streamed response and a WebSocket upgrade from a stand-in server; no forwarder on a node.
- **Night Shift on a client:** `/night add` refuses with the node message.
- **Remote jobs (Part 3), with `ssh` and `git` replaced by stand-ins:** a job cannot be composed without a memory cap and a time limit; the `authorized_keys` line written by `node add` carries the forced command and the no-terminal, no-forwarding options; `serve-job` refuses anything that is not one of its operations; the sandbox argument list has no read-write bind outside the worktree, the job's own `CODEX_HOME` and scratch; an agent job keeps the network namespace and a script job at `on` does not; `node add` reports lingering that is off; the stricter of two `/airgapped` levels is applied; a CPU-only job's environment hides the GPU; the setup result is reused for unchanged lock files; a job record survives its stream being closed.

Live, on two machines:
- a second Linux machine with nothing configured runs `puffin exec`, `puffin-search` and `puffin-app` against this GB10; the node's address is changed and the client finds it again;
- the node's model server stopped, then loading: the client prints the matching message of §6.4;
- `puffin-admin audit egress` on the node still passes with `node enable` on;
- per client system: the build runs, discovery works, the microphone works in `puffin-app`, and `/airgapped on` prints the right statement for that system.

## 17. Changes to other specs when this is built

- [README](./README.md): the header line "Deployment Model: single-node, air-gapped"; the two rows of §4 move to "Accepted by design".
- [ARCHITECTURE](./DREAMFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md): the two halves of §3.
- [SETUP](./DREAMFERENCE_SETUP.md): the installers and roles of §9.
- [ONYX](./DREAMFERENCE_ONYX.md): `bind_to_loopback()` becomes conditional on `node_advertise`; the SearXNG publish address.
- [PUFFIN_CODEX](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_CODEX.md): the resolution tiers, `puffin node`, the build targets.
- [PUFFIN_CODE_INDEX](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_CODE_INDEX.md): `puffin-code setup` and the per-system rules of §8.3.
- [PUFFIN_AIRGAPPED](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_AIRGAPPED.md): the statement for macOS and Windows; [PUFFIN_EGRESS](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_EGRESS.md): the allow-list entry for the node.
- [PUFFIN_NIGHT_SHIFT](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_NIGHT_SHIFT.md) and [PUFFIN_SWE_BENCH](./DREAMFERENCE_PUFFIN_SWE_BENCH.md): the client refusal; per-node parallelism in Part 2; `--on <node>`, the job sandbox and the setup command in Part 3.
