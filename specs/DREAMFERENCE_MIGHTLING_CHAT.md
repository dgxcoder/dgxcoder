# Mightling Chat: talking to Mightling from a phone messenger

**Status:** proposed 2026-10-08; Phase 1 is being built on branch `chat/messengers`, not merged (§14 says what was built and what was not).

**Spec owner:** the user. **Depends on:** MIGHTLING_ASK (Ask threads, `ling web`, the bridge policy), MIGHTLING_NODE (advertised nodes), MIGHTLING_AIRGAPPED, DOCKER §6 (sidecars).

---

## 0. Decisions, stated first

- **Two messengers, two levels of privacy (the user, 2026-10-08):**
  - **Matrix, private.** A Matrix homeserver runs on the node, and the phone reaches it over a Tailscale VPN. Messages and answers never leave the user's machines.
  - **Telegram, less private.** It is for users who accept that their messages and answers pass through Telegram's servers, where bot chats are not end-to-end encrypted. It is off until the user turns it on, and turning it on says exactly that and asks for a yes.
- **One bridge, two adapters.** `ling chat` is one process with a Matrix adapter and a Telegram adapter. Everything that is not messenger-specific is shared and tested once: threads, approvals, commands, rendering, splitting and access control.
- **A chat is an Ask thread** (MIGHTLING_ASK §3): no repository, a scratch folder, the `ask` prompt, and the same sandbox as an Ask thread in the browser. Threads started from a phone appear in the web UI and the desktop app, because they live in the same `ling app-server`.
- **The bridge is a client of `ling web`, never of the app-server directly.** Every message it sends passes the same bridge policy as a browser tab: allow-lists, dropped fields, named prompts and Ask folders. The policy stays in one place.
- **The bridge is a separate process, not part of `ling web`.** `ling web` promises it "calls nothing on any network". The Telegram adapter must reach `api.telegram.org`, so it lives elsewhere, and a crash in a messenger adapter cannot take the web UI down.
- **No open port for Telegram.** The adapter long-polls `getUpdates`, so no webhook and nothing reachable from the internet.
- **The private homeserver cannot reach the internet at all.** It runs on an internal Docker network (§5.2). This is enforced, not configured: no federation, no URL previews, no push gateway, because no route exists.

## 1. What the user gets

From the phone, in Element X (Matrix) or Telegram, a private chat with **Mightling**:

- **Questions and answers in a conversation.** Ask a question and get the answer as it is written. Telegram streams it live; Matrix shows "Mightling is typing…" and then the answer. The agent can search the web (at `/airgapped off`), read the user's files (`docs_*`), mail, Drive and Calendar (`/apps`), exactly as an Ask thread can.
- **Commands,** the same in both messengers:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/new` | The next message starts a new Ask thread. Without it, messages continue the current one. |
| `/stop` | Interrupts the running turn (`turn/interrupt`). Telegram's stop button on a streaming answer does the same. |
| `/threads` | The last 10 threads started from this chat, numbered, with their names. |
| `/use <n>` | Continues thread `n` from that list. |
| `/status` | Model server, air-gap level, the current thread, and whether a turn is running. |
| `/help` | This table. |
| `/pair <code>` | Telegram only: pairs this Telegram account (§4.1). |

- **Approvals on the phone.** When the agent asks for something (a command, a file change, more permissions, or an answer to a question), the chat shows the request with **Approve** and **Decline**: buttons in Telegram, ✅/❌ reactions or replying `yes`/`no` in Matrix. Nothing is approved by silence: after 10 minutes the bridge declines and says so.
- **A message during a running turn** steers it (`turn/steer` with `expectedTurnId` set to the running turn), as typing into a running session does. If the server refuses the steer, for example because the turn just ended, the message starts the next turn instead.

**Not in Phase 1** (§13): photos, files and voice messages; Work threads (a repository); queuing Night Shift tasks; group chats; end-to-end encryption inside Matrix (§5.4 says why it is not needed for privacy).

## 2. Architecture

```
 Element X ── Tailscale (WireGuard) ── tailscale serve (HTTPS, tailnet name)
                                              │
                                              ▼
                         tuwunel homeserver  (container, internal network: no route out)
                                              ▲  Client-Server API, as the bot account
                                              │
 Telegram app ── Telegram servers ◄── HTTPS long poll ── ling chat serve ──► ling web (127.0.0.1:3100, /ws)
                                                          (user unit)            │  bridge policy, Ask folders
                                                                                 ▼
                                                                          ling app-server ─► model server
```

- **`ling chat serve`** runs as the user unit `mightling-chat.service` (`ling chat start` and `stop`, as `ling web` does). It holds one bridge connection to `ling web` and runs each enabled adapter as a task. One adapter failing, for example Telegram unreachable, logs, backs off (exponential, capped at 5 minutes) and never stops the other.
- **Reaching `ling web`.** The bridge signs in the way `ling web ask` does: it writes a one-time login code into `ling web`'s state folder and trades it for a session cookie (MIGHTLING_ASK §16, `ask_client.rs`). The bridge runs as the user, outside any sandbox, so it can write that folder; a sandboxed command cannot. If `ling web` is not running, the bridge starts it (`ling web start`) and waits up to two minutes.
- **One bridge connection for every chat.** The connection carries every thread's notifications. The bridge routes them by `threadId` to the chat that owns the thread.
- **Reconnecting means signing in again.** Sessions made from one-time codes live in `ling web`'s memory (MIGHTLING_ASK §16), so a restarted `ling web` no longer knows the bridge's cookie. On a closed socket, or a refused upgrade, the bridge:
  1. writes a fresh login code and signs in again;
  2. reopens the bridge and resubscribes (`thread/resume`) to every thread with a turn in flight;
  3. reads back with `thread/turns/list` any turn that ended while it was away, so its answer is still delivered.
- **Night Shift gives way** to a chat turn as it does to a browser tab, because `ling web` keeps the busy marker per connection (MIGHTLING_DESKTOP §8.3).

## 3. The conversation model (shared by both adapters)

- **State.** `~/.mightling/chat/threads.json` maps each chat (`telegram:<chat id>` or `matrix:<room id>`) to its current thread and its last 10 threads. It is replaced whole, written via a temporary file and a rename.
- **A new thread** is `thread/start` with `{"prompt": "ask"}`. The policy makes it an Ask thread with its own scratch folder. The bridge names it from the first message's first 60 characters (`thread/name/set`).
- **A turn** is `turn/start` with the message text. The answer is the concatenation of `item/agentMessage/delta` for the thread, until `turn/completed`. An `error` notification without `willRetry` ends the turn and is reported to the chat in one line.
- **Rendering.** The model writes Markdown. A small renderer turns it into each messenger's format:
  - **What it renders:** bold, italic, inline code, code blocks, links, and headings rendered as bold. Everything else is escaped.
  - **Telegram:** its HTML subset.
  - **Matrix:** `formatted_body` (`org.matrix.custom.html`), with the plain text as `body`.
  - **If the format is refused** (Telegram's "can't parse entities"), the bridge resends as plain text. A failed render never loses an answer.
- **Splitting.** Telegram allows 4,096 characters per message, and the bridge splits Matrix messages at 16,000. Splits fall on a paragraph, then a line, then a word. A code block is closed at the split and reopened in the next part.
- **Approvals.**
  - **What is relayed:** a server request on the chat's thread becomes a chat message showing what is asked (the command, the reason, the files), cut to 1,000 characters.
  - **How it is answered:** the answer is the JSON-RPC response to that request, sent back through `ling web`. `ling web` accepts an answer only to a request it has seen and not yet answered (the policy's pending set).
  - **Who can answer:** only the paired user, in that chat.
  - **No choice in 10 minutes:** the bridge sends the decline payload and says so in the chat.
  - **The payloads,** from the pinned protocol (`app-server-protocol/src/protocol/v2/item.rs` and `permissions.rs`):

| Request | Shown | Approve sends | Decline sends |
|---|---|---|---|
| `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` | `command`, `reason`, `cwd` | `{"decision": "accept"}` | `{"decision": "decline"}` |
| `item/fileChange/requestApproval` | `reason`, `grantRoot` | `{"decision": "accept"}` | `{"decision": "decline"}` |
| `item/permissions/requestApproval` | `reason`, `permissions` (network, file system) | `{"permissions": <the requested profile>, "scope": "turn"}` | `{"permissions": {}, "scope": "turn"}` |
| `item/tool/requestUserInput` | each question's `header`, `question` and `options` | `{"answers": {"<question id>": {"answers": ["<chosen label or typed text>"]}}}` | the same with empty `answers` |

  - **Approve means once.** "For this session" (`acceptForSession`) and policy amendments are not offered from a phone. A question marked `isSecret` is refused with a line telling the user to answer it at a computer, because a secret typed into a messenger stays in its history.
- **Air gap.** The bridge reads the user-level air-gap level (`ling-airgapped`, the user's config file, not a repository's) every minute and at every message:
  - **At `on`,** the Telegram adapter stops relaying: incoming messages are answered with one line saying why, and nothing is sent to the agent. Matrix keeps working, because the whole path stays on the machine.
  - **What the agent sees:** Ask threads follow the air gap as usual, so at `on` the agent has no web search, whichever messenger asked.

## 4. Telegram

### 4.1 Turning it on, and pairing

1. **`ling chat telegram setup`.**
   - **The warning.** It explains, in four lines, that everything sent to the bot and every answer passes through Telegram's servers unencrypted, that this may include mail, files and code the agent reads, and that Telegram keeps the chat history. The user must type `yes`.
   - **The token.** It asks for the bot token from @BotFather, read from the terminal with echo off and never taken as an argument, where it would be visible in the process list. It checks the token with `getMe`, stores it, and prints the bot's `@username`.
   - **Without a terminal,** setup refuses: consent must be typed by a person.
2. **`ling chat telegram pair`** prints an 8-digit code, valid for 10 minutes and for one use. The user sends `/pair <code>` to the bot from Telegram, and the bridge records that Telegram **user id** (a number that never changes, unlike a username).
   - **Codes are stored only as SHA-256 hashes,** as `ling web` stores them.
   - **Ten wrong codes** withdraw every pending code.
3. **`ling chat telegram users`** lists the paired users. **`ling chat telegram remove <id>`** ends one. **`ling chat telegram off`** deletes the token and the pairings.

### 4.2 What the bot accepts

- **Private chats with a paired user only.**
  - **Unpaired senders:** a message from anyone else gets one reply ("This is a private Mightling. Ask its owner to pair you.") at most once a day per sender, and is otherwise ignored.
  - **Groups and channels:** the bot leaves them at once (`leaveChat`).
- **Update types requested:** `message`, `callback_query` and `stopped_message_generation` (`allowed_updates`). Edited messages, inline queries and everything else are ignored.

### 4.3 Streaming

- **Live drafts.** While a turn runs, the bridge calls `sendMessageDraft` with the answer so far, at most once a second and at least every 20 seconds, since a draft lives 30 seconds. The draft carries `can_stop: true`, so Telegram shows a stop button. Pressing it arrives as `stopped_message_generation` and becomes `turn/interrupt`.
- **Before the first text,** an empty draft shows Telegram's own "Thinking…" placeholder.
- **The final answer** is `sendMessage`, which replaces the draft.
- **Drafts cut at 4,096 characters:** the draft shows the last 4,096 characters, and the final message is split (§3).
- **If `sendMessageDraft` is unavailable** (a Bot API error naming the method), the bridge falls back to `sendChatAction typing` every 4 seconds and the final message.
- **Commands** are registered with `setMyCommands` at start, so Telegram offers them on `/`.

### 4.4 Network

- **Destinations:** `https://api.telegram.org` only, with `getUpdates` long-polling (`timeout` 50 s). No webhook and no listening port.
- **Rate limits:** a `retry_after` answer is honoured.
- **Telegram unreachable:** the adapter backs off and retries. Matrix is unaffected.

## 5. Matrix

### 5.1 The homeserver

**tuwunel** (the maintained successor to conduwuit, Apache-2.0, `ghcr.io/matrix-construct/tuwunel`, arm64 and x86-64 images, release 1.9.3 of 2026-09-25):
- **Why tuwunel:** one Rust process with an embedded RocksDB, no PostgreSQL, a small memory footprint, and simplified sliding sync (`/sync` v5), which Element X needs.
- **Why not the others:** Synapse would need PostgreSQL and much more memory, and Dendrite is archived.

`ling-admin chat matrix start` (Python, beside the other sidecars, DOCKER §6):
- **The container:** `dreamference-matrix`, image pinned by digest, memory capped at `--memory=1g` (swap equal), data in the volume `dreamference-matrix-data`.
- **Its configuration** (environment):
  - `TUWUNEL_SERVER_NAME`: the server name (§5.3);
  - `TUWUNEL_ALLOW_FEDERATION=false`;
  - `TUWUNEL_ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true` with a random `TUWUNEL_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` (32 bytes). The token is needed to create any account, and the bridge uses it to create its own account and the user's;
  - `TUWUNEL_TRUSTED_SERVERS=[]`;
  - `TUWUNEL_URL_PREVIEW_DOMAIN_EXPLICIT_ALLOWLIST=[]`.
- **Its accounts:** creates the bot account `@mightling:<server name>` and stores its access token for the bridge.
- **`ling-admin chat matrix add-user <name>`** creates a user account with a generated password, printed once on the terminal and never stored, and adds the user to the bridge's allow-list.
- **`ling-admin chat matrix status`** reports the container, the address, the Tailscale state, the accounts and the allow-list. **`ling-admin chat matrix stop`** stops the container and keeps the volume.

### 5.2 No route out

- **An internal Docker network.** The container runs on `dreamference-matrix`, created `--internal` with a fixed subnet (`172.31.231.0/24`), and the container has a fixed address (`.10`).
- **No way out:**
  - an internal network has no route to anything but the host;
  - with federation off there is nothing to contact anyway.
- **The host reaches it through a loopback proxy.** Docker publishes no ports for a container on an internal network, and `tailscale serve` may refuse a backend that is not on loopback. So `ling-admin chat matrix start` also installs two user units:
  - `mightling-matrix-proxy.socket`, listening on `127.0.0.1:6167`;
  - `mightling-matrix-proxy.service`, running systemd's own `systemd-socket-proxyd 172.31.231.10:6167`.

  Nothing is added to install: the proxy ships with systemd. The bridge and `tailscale serve` both use `http://127.0.0.1:6167`. The host can reach the container's address across the internal network's bridge, the direction SWE-bench already relies on.
- **The consequence: no push notifications.**
  - **Element X's push gateway is unreachable.** The homeserver cannot reach it (sygnal at matrix.org, then Google or Apple), so the phone is notified only while Element X keeps its own connection.
  - **Android:** that works in the background.
  - **iOS:** it works only while the app is open, or briefly after.
  - **The opt-in:** `ling-admin chat matrix push on` moves the container to the sidecar network, so pushes go out. A push carries the event id only (Element X's `event_id_only` format), so no message content leaves the machine, but metadata does: that a message arrived, and when. It is off by default.

### 5.3 Reaching it from the phone

- **With Tailscale (the decided route).**
  - **The setup check:** `ling-admin chat matrix start` finds Tailscale running and signed in (`tailscale status --json`). It takes the node's tailnet name (`Self.DNSName` without its trailing dot, for example `gx10-9428.tail1234.ts.net`) as the **server name**, and runs `tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:6167`.
  - **The server name is permanent.** Every account's id ends in it (`@stan:gx10-9428.tail1234.ts.net`), and Matrix has no way to rename a server. It is chosen once, stored in `matrix.json`, and passed to the container on every start. Renaming the machine, or moving it to another tailnet, changes its tailnet name: from then on `start` refuses, naming both names. The user either renames the machine back, or removes the homeserver (`ling-admin chat matrix remove`, which deletes the volume) and starts again with new accounts.
  - **Signing in:** the phone, with Tailscale installed and signed in to the same tailnet, signs in to `https://<tailnet name>` in Element X.
  - **The certificate:** a real one, issued by Let's Encrypt through Tailscale. This needs HTTPS turned on once in the tailnet's admin console, and the command says so when it is off.
  - **The privacy cost:** the tailnet name appears in public Certificate Transparency logs. The name is public; nothing about messages is.
- **Without Tailscale: not in Phase 1.** `start` refuses and prints how to install Tailscale. A LAN-only mode (the `.local` name over plain HTTP) waits for Phase 0 to show whether Element X accepts a homeserver without HTTPS at all.
- **Installing Tailscale is left to the user.** `ling-admin chat matrix start` does not install it: it needs root, and signing in to a tailnet is an interactive step with the user's account. The command prints the two install lines and stops. Headscale (self-hosted coordination) works the same way and is named as the fully self-hosted alternative.

### 5.4 Rooms and encryption

- **The bridge opens the room.** When the allow-list gains a user, the bridge creates a direct room (`createRoom`, `is_direct: true`, `preset: private_chat`, **no `m.room.encryption`**) and invites them. The user accepts the invite from "Mightling" in Element X.
- **Invites the bridge accepts:** only from allow-listed users, and only to rooms with two members.
- **Rooms the bridge leaves at once:**
  - an encrypted room (one with `m.room.encryption`), after one plain message explaining it;
  - a room that gains a third member.
- **Why no end-to-end encryption.**
  - **Everything is on the node:** the homeserver, the bridge and the agent are all on the node, and the phone's traffic is inside WireGuard and TLS.
  - **E2EE would protect only against the node itself,** which is also where the agent reads every message in plain text to answer it.
  - **The cost would be real:** a crypto store, device verification, and key backup for a bot.
  - **Revisit if** the homeserver ever runs somewhere other than the node.
- **Sync.**
  - **Request:** the bridge long-polls `/sync` (v3, `timeout` 30 s), keeping `next_batch` in its state file. The filter asks only for the event types it handles: `m.room.message` and `m.reaction` in the timeline, `m.room.member` and `m.room.encryption` in the state.
  - **What it ignores:** events older than its start and its own events.
  - **Typing:** "Mightling is typing…" is `PUT /typing` (30 s, renewed) while a turn runs.

## 6. Credentials and their threat model

`~/.mightling/chat/` is a folder (mode 0700) holding:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `telegram.json` | the bot token, the consent date, and the paired user ids |
| `matrix.json` | the homeserver URL, the bot's user id and access token, and the allow-list |
| `threads.json` | the chat → thread map |
| `pairing/` | pending code hashes |

**Stated plainly, as for the Google tokens (GOA §0): these files are readable by any command the agent runs.** Codex's sandbox limits writes, not reads. What that means:

- **A stolen Telegram token** lets someone read messages sent to the bot before the bridge does, and send messages as the bot. It does **not** let them command the agent: the bridge acts only on updates Telegram delivers from a paired user id, and Telegram cannot be made to deliver forged ones. `ling chat telegram setup` again, after `/revoke` in @BotFather, rotates the token.
- **A stolen Matrix bot token** is usable only from inside the tailnet or the node, since the homeserver is not on the internet.
- **Pairing cannot be done from a sandbox.** Pairing needs a code that only `ling chat telegram pair`, run by the user, creates. A sandboxed command cannot write the `pairing/` folder (the sandbox's writable roots exclude it), and codes are stored as hashes.

## 7. CLI

```
ling chat start | stop | status | serve          the bridge (user unit mightling-chat.service)
ling chat telegram setup | pair | users | remove <id> | off
ling-admin chat matrix start | stop | status | add-user <name> | push on|off | remove
```

- **`ling chat status`** reports:
  - each adapter: on or off, connected or not, and since when;
  - the paired users;
  - the threads with a running turn.
- **`ling chat start`** refuses when no adapter is configured, and says which command configures one.
- **The homeserver commands are `ling-admin`'s,** because containers are (DOCKER §6). The bridge reads `matrix.json`, which they write.

## 8. Egress

- **`ling chat`'s destinations, and nothing else:**
  - `127.0.0.1:<ling web>`;
  - the homeserver, through the loopback proxy at `127.0.0.1:6167`;
  - `api.telegram.org:443`, only when Telegram is on.
- **The homeserver container:** none (§5.2), unless `push on`.
- **The agent's own egress is unchanged,** because a chat turn is an Ask turn. `ling-admin audit egress` covers sessions, not the bridge. The bridge's destinations are listed here and checked by its tests, which run against stand-in servers only.

## 9. Night Shift, nodes and clients

- **Night Shift:** a chat turn counts as a person at a terminal (§2).
- **Where it runs:** on a node. On a client (a laptop), `ling chat` works against that client's own `ling web`, but the homeserver belongs on the node, which is always on. `ling-admin chat matrix start` refuses on a machine without a node id.

## 10. Configuration

`[chat]` in the user's config file (`~/.config/dreamference/config.toml`), never the repository's:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `approval_timeout_s` | 600 | when an unanswered approval is declined |
| `telegram_draft_interval_ms` | 1000 | minimum gap between draft updates |
| `max_threads_listed` | 10 | `/threads` |

## 11. Phase 0, measured before relying on it

1. **Element X:**
   - signing in to tuwunel through `tailscale serve`;
   - joining the bridge's unencrypted DM, and what it shows;
   - with plain HTTP on the LAN, whether it connects at all.
2. **The loopback proxy:** `systemd-socket-proxyd` reaching the container on the internal network from the host, and `tailscale serve` in front of it. If the host cannot reach an internal network's containers on some Docker version, the fallback is an ordinary sidecar network with the homeserver's outbound traffic blocked by tuwunel's own settings, a weaker guarantee that §0 would then have to state.
3. **Telegram on a real phone:**
   - `sendMessageDraft` streaming, the stop button, and `stopped_message_generation`;
   - a 10,000-character answer with code blocks, split.
4. **tuwunel:**
   - memory at rest and while syncing;
   - registration with the token through the client-server API;
   - that `/sync` v3 long-poll works for a bot.

## 12. Tests

All tests use stand-ins. None reaches Telegram, a homeserver, `ling web` or Docker.

- **Bridge core:**
  - routing notifications to the right chat;
  - `/new`, `/use` and `/threads`;
  - steering during a turn;
  - approvals: answered, declined, timed out, and an answer to a request that was never asked, which is refused;
  - air gap `on` stopping Telegram and not Matrix;
  - the renderer and the splitter (code blocks across splits, plain-text fallback);
  - reconnecting to `ling web` mid-turn and still delivering the answer.
- **Telegram adapter,** against a stand-in Bot API (an axum server):
  - pairing: one use, expiry, ten wrong codes;
  - an unpaired sender gets one reply a day;
  - a group is left;
  - drafts throttled, with the final message replacing them;
  - the stop button interrupts;
  - fallback without `sendMessageDraft`;
  - `retry_after` honoured;
  - the token never appears in logs or arguments.
- **Matrix adapter,** against a stand-in homeserver:
  - an invite from someone not on the allow-list is ignored;
  - an encrypted room is left;
  - a third member makes the bridge leave;
  - reactions and `yes`/`no` answer approvals;
  - typing is renewed;
  - `next_batch` persists across restarts.
- **`ling-admin chat matrix`,** with Docker and Tailscale mocked:
  - the internal network and fixed address, and the proxy units;
  - the server name stored once, and `start` refusing when Tailscale's name has changed;
  - federation off and the registration token set;
  - the `tailscale serve` command line;
  - refusing on a machine without a node id;
  - `push on` moves the network;
  - `add-user` prints the password once and stores none.

## 13. Phases

- **Phase 1 (this branch):**
  - the bridge, both adapters, and `ling chat` with its user unit;
  - `ling-admin chat matrix`;
  - the tests above.
- **Phase 2:**
  - photos and files, through `/api/upload` into the thread's folder;
  - voice messages, through the speech sidecar, once `/api/transcribe` exists (MIGHTLING_ASK §7);
  - `/night add <repo> <task>`;
  - push opt-in verified on iOS.
- **Phase 3:**
  - Work threads on a repository chosen from the phone, with approvals;
  - other messengers, if users ask (Signal through `signal-cli` is the obvious next, with the caveats its own project states).

## 14. What was built

*(Filled in when Phase 1 lands.)*
