Mightling Desktop App Runner.

This module provides the DesktopRunner class, which builds and launches the Electron app in
`desktop/electron` (specs/DREAMFERENCE_MIGHTLING_DESKTOP_ELECTRON.md), built the way the Codex
desktop app is built: Electron Forge, with `ling` bundled inside as `resources/ling`.

The app has one window, the Mightling UI built from `desktop/ui` and bundled by the same Vite
build as the main process. It shows Ask (the menu's former Chat, which showed the Onyx web UI until
2026-10-08 and was a window of its own on `ling web` until 2026-10-09) and Work, both on the one
`ling app-server` the app starts (specs/DREAMFERENCE_MIGHTLING_ASK.md §18.6). It needs neither
Onyx nor `ling web`, so nothing is checked before the window opens: it says on its own start-up
screen what it is waiting for.

It follows the same shape as the agent runners: provision the tooling if it is missing, then hand
off to a subprocess.
