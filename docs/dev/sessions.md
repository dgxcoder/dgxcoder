# Work streams and their status

Since 2026-10-10 the work runs as parallel streams (three, then four), each in its own working tree, so that no two
writers share a checkout. This file is their shared status board: **each stream appends one dated line
when it hands work off or finishes a piece, and reads the file when it starts.** It is the only place
where the streams can see each other; nothing else is shared but the git remotes. Lines are appended
with `session-note "<what changed>"` (a helper outside the repository that commits to this file through
a small clone of its own), or by hand; keep the newest at the bottom, one line each, and never rewrite
another stream's lines.

| Stream | Working tree | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **operations** | the main checkout of mightling | the SWE-bench nights and their watcher, the model server and the model gate, the installed `ling` and the install directory, second-puffin as a machine (containers, pairing, lane), releases and their pre-release checks, audits |
| **product** | `.claude/worktrees/product` (branch `work/product`) | mightling's code, tests, specs and docs; pushes through origin after a rebase; treats the model server, the gate, the install directory and second-puffin as read-only |
| **engine** | `~/PycharmProjects/ling-engine` | ling-engine's C++/CUDA, specs and reports; builds, tests and measures on second-puffin only; moves the submodule pointer in mightling through a note here, not by editing a mightling checkout |
| **crew** | `~/PycharmProjects/mighty-crew` (repository `dreamference/mighty-crew`) | the Mighty Crew product: the spec and the `crew` binary that runs a crew of coding-agent sessions on one codebase (what this board and the launcher do by hand); touches no other checkout |

A request that crosses a boundary (the engine stream needs the GPU without the reference container; the
product stream needs a new `ling` build installed) is a line here addressed to the stream that owns it.

## Status

- 2026-10-10 15:00 operations: night 1 running since 09:49 (default arm 34/50); night 2 (44 tasks) chains when it writes `done`; 1.6.0 prepared on `release/1.6.0`, cut Sunday evening after night 2; the model gate stays closed until then.
- 2026-10-10 15:00 engine: §16.1 microbenchmarks measured and committed (ling-engine 2384ddb, 1edc433; submodule at 1edc433); `--draft-block` defaults to 12; next: Codex Responses completeness, custom tools first (BACKLOG §19.13, §19.15).
- 2026-10-10 15:00 product: stream started on `work/product` at 5a0adb2; nothing handed off yet.
- 2026-10-10 15:03 operations: status board docs/dev/sessions.md and the session-note helper are in place; read the board at start, append a line at each hand-off
- 2026-10-10 15:25 operations: stream `crew` added (session 4): the Mighty Crew MVP spec is being written and the repository dreamference/mighty-crew created; decisions: public, Claude Code only in the MVP, Rust from the start, all roles bypass prompts.
- 2026-10-10 15:23 operations: to engine, from the user: work order is (1) Codex Responses completeness, custom tools first (BACKLOG §19.13); (2) reasoning_tokens counted and the ignored request fields honoured or refused (§19.15, §19.7, §19.11); (3) the 12-draft acceptance histogram on the tuning set; (4) M2 tree speculation, then M4 resident sessions and batches; (5) B34 BF16 prefill intermediates when the GPU is free. Items 1-2 need the model on second-puffin: ask operations for a window to stop m0-prod8000 between the nights.
- 2026-10-10 15:26 operations: crew stream: repository dreamference/mighty-crew created (public) with the MVP spec specs/DREAMFERENCE_MIGHTY_CREW.md, AGENTS.md and the shell prototype; 'session 4' starts the crew session; first task there: the Rust 'crew' binary, start/board/note/status first
- 2026-10-10 15:35 operations: nights run on this machine alone from night 1's second arm on (nodes = none, fc1e1ab); second-puffin and m0-prod8000 are the engine's for the weekend; the three unpushed branches (spec/pdf-self-speeding, compaction/phase2, quality/phase0) are on origin; engine reports custom tools built and passing beside m0-prod8000
- 2026-10-10 15:41 operations: to crew: twelve spec ideas from today's inter-session review sent by message (holds are directional and need doctor/restart; every msg gets a board twin; crew now for live status; verify-before-create; evidence in work orders; optional dispatcher role; refuse a second session on one tree; forks in throwaway worktrees; msg reports only 'in inbox'; link agent memory; clock-stamped notes and add-role; crew wait)
- 2026-10-10 15:45 product: product: pushed to main (8e87441): draw --exclude with the 68-entry mismatch list out by default (committed under docs/dev/swe-bench/), and the suite offline by construction (conftest fails any spawn of the installed ling and any connection to ports 8000/18000; test_mightling_slash_commands.py opts in by the installed_binary marker). Measured: no test ran the installed ling; the time is stand-in processes and sleeps; 1090 tests in ~100 s after trimming, AGENTS.md says so. Next: the offline system prompt (rank 5), then the survey's harness items.
- 2026-10-10 15:48 operations: decisions: both machines stay on through Sunday; 1.6.0 draft dispatched from release/1.6.0 (CI run 38060725983, tag at publish only); watcher pushes only on failure; night 3 (ARMS from night 1's winner + issue-v1) chains after night 2 but only after the cut; crew binary replaces the launcher after the cut once §9 passes; product tests the client on the laptop; Code Mode capture and stall diagnosis running against second-puffin now
- 2026-10-10 15:49 product: product: correction: the push landed as 4168956 on main (rebased on a9a8896; the first push was refused), not 8e87441. Laptop client test started (scratch HOME on the laptop, 1.5.1 public release, second-puffin's server). The offline prompt is coded in ling-rs (prompt.rs, built-in 'offline'); launcher tests running in the build export; on main soon, build at operations' convenience.
