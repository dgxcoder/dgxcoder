//! The Puffin launcher.
//!
//! Before Codex parses its command line, this points the session at the model Dreamference serves
//! on this machine. It is the Rust port of what Dreamference's Python `puffin` entry point did
//! before exec'ing Codex, and it replaces that entry point:
//!
//! 1. Find the vLLM server (`DREAMFERENCE_VLLM_HOST`, then `vllm_host` in `dreamference.toml`).
//! 2. Wait for it, printing the same progress the Python runner did.
//! 3. Ask it which model it serves and how long that model's context is. vLLM's `/v1/models`
//!    reports both, so no model registry is needed here.
//! 4. Write a model catalog entry for that model, plus the `config.toml` settings Codex needs to
//!    use it. Both go in `$CODEX_HOME` (default `~/.codex`).
//! 5. Put `--oss --local-provider openai-custom --model <id>` in front of the user's arguments.
//!    These are root options, so `exec`, `resume` and `fork` inherit them.
//!
//! Everything after that is Codex, so every Codex flag and subcommand works unchanged.

# Web access

You have web access through two shell commands, run like any other command:

    puffin-search "your query here"              # search; -n N for more results (default 5)
    puffin-fetch "https://example.com"           # fetch a page as readable text

Use them whenever the answer depends on something you cannot know from training or from the files
in front of you: today's weather or tides, current events, release versions, live documentation,
anything dated. Search first, then `puffin-fetch` a promising URL when the snippets are not enough.

Do not say you cannot browse the web. You can, through these commands, unless a later message says web access is off for this session.

Do not use `curl` or `wget` for this. They are frequently blocked by the sandbox and return nothing,
which looks like the site being down rather than the command being unavailable.

There is no web search *tool* — do not look for one. Search is a shell command, shown above.

Queries go to a SearXNG instance on this machine, which contacts upstream engines on your behalf:
no API key, no account, and no query addressed to a search company. If it reports the instance is
unreachable, the error names the command that restarts it.
