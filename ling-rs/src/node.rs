//! Finding the Mightling node (specs/DREAMFERENCE_MIGHTLING_NODE.md §5.3, §6).
//!
//! Before the client/server split the launcher talked to `localhost:8000` unless told otherwise.
//! It now resolves where the model server is through tiers, the first that yields a host winning:
//!
//! 1. `DREAMFERENCE_VLLM_HOST`, then `vllm_host` in a configuration file: "I know where it is";
//! 2. `MIGHTLING_NODE=<name>`: one node, for one command;
//! 3. this machine is a node (it has `~/.config/dreamference/node-id`): loopback, and no browse;
//! 4. the node remembered in `$CODEX_HOME/node.json`, found again on the network **by its id**, so
//!    an address change costs nothing; its last address is tried only when a browse returns
//!    nothing at all;
//! 5. a browse of `_mightling-node._tcp`: one node is used and remembered, several are a question.
//!
//! A node other than the remembered one is never adopted silently: prompts and source code go to
//! whichever node is chosen. `ling node list|use|forget` is the same logic from a shell.
//!
//! Only this module browses. `ling-search` and the others read `node.json` through the
//! `ling-node-locator` crate, so they need no multicast and work inside the sandbox.
